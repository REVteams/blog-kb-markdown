#### Definition

The term go-to-market (GTM) — sometimes also called go-to-market strategy — refers to a type of in-depth action plan compiled by businesses of different sizes. Through the GTM plan, businesses set their strategies on how they intend to win over new [buyers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) for their products or services, increase their presence on the marketplace they operate in, expand to new marketplaces, increase their profits, and attain goals related to sales, marketing and [return on investment](https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/r/return-investment-roi).

#### Why Are Go-to-Market Strategies Important

As new businesses constantly arise and new models develop, the ever-expanding global marketplace is becoming more and more competitive. This level of competitiveness creates an urgency for businesses to come up with new products or services — and sometimes even re-brand old ones — to be able to keep up with the pace of the market and get a positive return on investment.

When businesses take on the risk of launching new products and/or services to the market, they have to prepare for and plan the launch properly to avoid failure and losses. To achieve this, they often rely on good GTM strategies. With some advanced planning, businesses can develop GTM strategies that are not too complicated to implement in practice, effective at giving them an edge over their competition, and easy to follow and modify during or after their implementation — that is, in case [data](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-data) analytics and [client](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) feedback suggest they need to be changed.

Except for new product or service launches, compiling solid GTM strategies is also important for emerging start-ups, upgrading existing products/services, and other marketing moves. Businesses that don’t take their time when developing GTM action plans are more likely to develop ineffective marketing budgets, which can result in decreased earnings and drastically lower profitability.

All of this means that a GTM strategy can be vital for a business’s entrepreneurial endeavors, revenue, and overall success. This is why many businesses make their GTM strategies a top priority regardless of their size.

#### How Businesses Use GTM Strategies

As the name itself suggests, go-to-market can be applied to a business’s marketing strategy. When thought out in a detailed way, GTM strategies help businesses stick to their focus on the market as well as the customers they sell to.

As a result, through the implementation of proper GMT strategies, businesses can locate and deal with their weak spots in marketing. This practice also helps businesses develop a more accepting approach towards novel ideas and the many benefits that the launching of new products or services can bring them.

Businesses can also use their GTM plans as a stepping stone to help them reach their goals in terms of marketing and profits — the achievement of these goals being outlined in the GTM plan itself. As a framework for the direction which a business’s marketing strategy will take, the GTM plan also helps businesses save money and time on marketing planning, accelerate sales, and increase return on investment in the long run.

#### How to Create a Good GTM Strategy

There are several important steps businesses need to follow that would result in quality GTM strategies.

### Preparation

To begin with, businesses have to answer the so-called [5 Ws and 1 H](https://www.workfront.com/blog/project-management-101-the-5-ws-and-1-h-that-should-be-asked-of-every-project) of marketing (the why, who, what, where, when, and how) in order to set the stage for developing a solid GTM plan.

* **Why** — Businesses need to be aware of the reason why they want to allocate their marketing budget on a particular GTM plan. This includes being aware of whether it will pay for them to, say, invest in the launching of a particular product, the placement of goods on new markets, and so on.
* **Who** — Another thing businesses must know before developing a GTM strategy is the target group they aim to sell to. This means they should decide what particular audiences they should influence with their marketing messages, and try to understand the wants and needs of these audiences.
* **What** — The ‘what’ part determines what customers and clients expect from the business, what solutions the business can provide through its products or services, what steps it should take to attract buyers (in terms of marketing and sales), what strategies it will use to promote its products/services on the market, and so on.
* **Where** — Businesses also need to know where they can place and advertise their products or services. This means they need to know whether they should focus only on internet ads, arrange advertising meet-ups, participate in public events where they can promote what they’re selling, and so on.
* **When** — Determining when products and services are ready to be launched is another task businesses should dedicate their attention to. Oftentimes, companies will rush to place their newly developed products or services on the market as soon as possible to gain an advantage over their competition. This isn’t always the case, though, as placement timing can also depend on other factors such as the season during which particular items can be sold, for instance.
* **How** — The final thing to answer from this list is the ‘how’. Businesses need to decide how a product or service can be placed on the market, how to [convert](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) leads into customers, how they can evaluate their marketing campaigns and modify them when the need arises, and so on.

Having answered these questions, businesses can then easily proceed to chart out all the details of a successful GTM strategy.

### Finalizing the Strategy

The final steps to developing a GTM strategy that a business should take include:

* Determining the buyers of the products and services of a business and their [customer personas](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/customer-personas), as well as deciding what members of the business different departments and teams can have a role in the selling process;
* Establishing what customer problems concrete products or services can solve for each customer persona, and adapting the marketing messages to accentuate these solutions to the customers in question, accordingly;
* Testing and refining each concrete message aimed at the customers;
* Finding appropriate marketing channels for placing the products or services on the market;
* Establishing what steps each potential customer needs to take in order to be converted to a paying customer;
* Pick a sales strategy, namely one of the strategies commonly associated with GTM plans including self-service (customers buying products themselves, usually online), inside sales (focusing on long sales cycles and developing long-standing relationships with clients), field sales (where sales professionals contact prospects directly and try to [close deals](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal) with them), and [channel sales](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-channel-sales) (where third-party distribution channels are used to sell the business’s products and services);
* Creating content needed for [lead generation](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht);
* Optimizing the [sales and marketing pipeline](https://sendpulse.com/support/glossary/pipeline-marketing) by evaluating the effectiveness of the GTM strategy through [key performance indicators (KPIs)](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator), and making modifications based on these results;
* Understanding the customers’ pain points and analyzing their feedback as a means to speed up sales;
* Using marketing automation tools to reduce [customer acquisition costs (CAC)](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-customer-acquisition-cost-cac).

The above steps cover all the key aspects included in developing GTM strategies.

#### Summary

A go-to-market (GTM) strategy is a type of action plan that businesses of all sizes can use. Through GTM strategies, businesses map out their plans on how to acquire new buyers, increase their market presence, expand to new markets, increase profits and achieve goals.

GTM strategies play a significant role in giving businesses an advantage over their competition. This is particularly so when a business decides to launch new products and services — without a properly developed GTM action plan, the business risks facing failure and monetary losses. Apart from that, GTM strategies are also significant for businesses launching new start-ups, making upgrades to their products or services, and a variety of other marketing purposes.

Businesses can also make use of GTM strategies to locate their weaknesses in marketing, become more open to novel ideas, and reach their marketing and revenue goals. In the long run, GTM strategies help businesses save time and money on their marketing strategies, speed up sales, and increase their return on investment.

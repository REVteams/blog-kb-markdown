### Definition

Enterprise sales is the process of selling products or services to businesses, rather than consumers.

It can be a great way to expand your customer base and increase revenue. By understanding enterprise sales techniques and sales strategies, you can position your company for success in this market.

#### Why is Enterprise Sales important for your business?

Once you have established the product-market fit of your SaaS startup you will spend a lot of time thinking about the best sales model for your business. This is something that you must do at the time of going to market and again when you decide how and when you want to scale.

So what is enterprise sales in relation to complex sales? Both terms are used interchangeably since they have the same meaning. They can also be known as enterprise sales.

Complex sales refers to the acquisition of large contracts that often involve long sales cycles, multiple decision-makers, and a higher risk than traditional sales (also known as SMB, which refers to sales to small and medium-sized businesses).

Enterprise sales are sales that involve large-scale corporate solutions. It is important to note that transactional sales are a common focus for startups in the early stages. They typically involve less risk, have shorter sales cycles, and are driven by sales and marketing.

#### Is Enterprise Sales right for your organization?

Enterprise sales can be a great sales model for startups in certain cases. Enterprise sales might make sense for your SaaS startup if you're creating a solution that is critical to the success or strategic impact on large corporations.

Let's say, for example, that you have revolutionary blockchain software to manage supply chain management. Enterprise sales would be the best sales model for your company.

### What is an enterprise selling model?

Three main types of sales models exist in the SaaS industry:

* Self-Service Sales
* Transactional Sales
* Enterprise Sales

#### Self-Service Sales

This is a popular model that companies like Zoho or Dropbox use. This model is ideal for companies that sell low-cost products and has a low customer acquisition cost. The customer does the majority of the decision-making, signs up, and then uses the product at their own pace.

The self-service model, when combined with extensive website help documentation, keeps your customer support/enterprise sales reps at a minimum. This allows them to concentrate on other aspects of growing your business.

#### Transactional Sales

This has proven to be a winning sales model for SaaS providers such as Marketo and Zendesk. Transactional distribution is somewhere in between enterprise and self-service sales. It offers flexible solutions for a wide range of customers. Some purchases can be done directly from the company website.

Others require a dialogue with a member of the enterprise sales reps.

Transactional sales volumes are less than self-service but at a higher price point. Transactions are usually more complex, which means that there is a longer sales cycle.

This model is ideal for SaaS companies with a more expensive product. This model is designed to help the marketing team drive qualified leads and the sales department to quickly close on them. The goal is to achieve sustainable, high-volume sales with an efficient onboarding process.

#### Enterprise Sales

Enterprise sales models are often adopted by companies that have high prices and technical products that require more training, integration, support, and customer service. Sales cycles can be long and expensive, so it is important to consider the cost of acquisition.

Only a few SaaS companies have seen success with this model. Enterprise customers are only considered if the product, sales, support, and monthly revenue can sustain the intense demands placed upon them.

Before you market to enterprise customers, you need to consider the following:

* **Onboarding:** Will it be a smooth and quick process that won't slow down the company?
* **Security:** Will their company data be fully secured? Can data access be restricted between employees and teams within the company?
* **Customer support:** Is there 24/7 access to someone in an emergency?
* **Proofs of return on investment:** If your product starts to lose money, it's going to cost you *a lot*.
* **Automation:** Will it save their team's time or make them more work?
* **Social proof:** Are similar companies using this product with positive results?

Enterprise sales require more thought and effort than the other sales models. Self-service and transactional sales are primarily driven primarily by good old-fashioned marketing. The enterprise sales model is driven by building strong long-term relationships.

It's not easy to close the first deal and nurture the relationship into a long-term partnership. However, it can be very rewarding.

### Enterprise Strategy and Sales Process

#### 1. Calculate your Total Addressable Market (TAM)

This is an extremely important topic. This is a quick overview of the three main ways you can calculate your TAM.

1. Use Industry research and reports
2. Get out there and see how the market responds
3. Make educated guesses about the buyer's willingness and ability to pay

Each one has its own merits. To get the best picture, you could use them all together.

#### 2. Start with the accounts that you feel are the best

A strong pipeline is a powerful tool for the enterprise sales process. It can outperform all other tools. A strong pipeline should be filled with both short-term and long-term opportunities.

Enterprise sales can be a complicated game. You must prioritize your time with accounts that are best suited for your business.

Once you know your [ICP (ideal customer profile)](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-an-ideal-customer-profile-icp), it's easy to scale from there. Knowing your ICP will ensure that you are not chasing the wrong buyers and wasting your time.

#### 3. Get deep inside your prospects' world

Once you have a prioritized list of key targets you want to pursue, set up alerts for industry and company news. You should be looking for announcements, acquisitions, changes, and new business.

**Enterprise Sales: You must ask yourself:**

* What is going on in the market?
* What are their challenges?
* What are the common themes across different verticals or segments?
* What do their annual reports or earnings calls have to say about them?
* What is their roadmap?

#### 4. Identify the organization and engage decision-makers

Identify who you think will be involved with the buying cycle. Who will be your buyer? Who will be your influencer?

A framework will help you to be efficient and not miss important aspects of the enterprise sales journey. Once your understanding of the people you are is clear, it's time for you to engage them!

#### 5. Consult... don't sell!

Enterprise buyers have different priorities and are being approached constantly.

Once contact has been made, you will need to find different ways to add value to their goals and stand out from the rest.

Your mindset and approach are crucial here. This is about creating the best solution together, not selling.

This stage is all about asking great questions and gaining deep insight. Listen, adjust, pivot, then respond in earnest to get the job done!

Find the space between the lines that no one else would notice and fill it with your ideas.

You can make them more open to your offer if you do this well. Remember that buyers, especially those in enterprise sales, want to be heard and understood. They need no BS solutions that will move the needle.

Watch enterprise sales magic happen when you let go of your agenda and embrace your buyers.

#### 6. Expand and land

Many enterprise sales reps start with smaller enterprise deals that are more manageable (such as a pilot or proof of concept trial), to reduce risk and barriers to entry.

This is great for getting your foot in front of buyers, but it can also be very time-consuming. This is especially true for global companies with multiple business units that operate under their P&L.

Sometimes, it can take years to go from pilot to full-size deal.

The best enterprise sellers understand that hard work doesn't end when a contract has been signed. There is always more growth potential than you realize, and that's why you should expand the solution you offer!

You must keep up with changes in the market and their trajectory to do enterprise sales well over the long term. You should be a trusted confidant that they can turn to when they have questions.

You can also help them identify potential blind spots and opportunities. Good is contagious... always.

### How Enterprise Sales Model differs from SMB or Mid-Market Sales

SMBs are usually defined by the number and revenue of employees in a company. Small businesses are those with fewer than 100 employees, less than \$50,000,000 in revenue, and middle-sized companies have between 100 and 999 employees and between \$50,000,000 and $1 billion in revenues.

An enterprise sales strategy is necessary if you sell to companies with more employees or revenue. You may also consider adding other sales types to your mix depending on the demographics of your buyers.

#### Measure your enterprise's success

We all know that closing an enterprise deal can take forever. So what KPIs are you able to measure during and after the process? Which KPIs will help you make your next deal shorter and more intelligent?

There are three sales KPIs that can be used to increase enterprise sales.

1. **Account perception:** Compare your market sales to those of the competition.
2. **Deal size:** A measure of your return on investments.
3. **Sales velocity:** This is a metric that is often overlooked to measure the health and efficiency of your sales system.

It is possible to gain a meaningful understanding of a process that may seem complicated or endless if you carefully track each one. You will feel more comfortable knowing that you are making intelligent enterprise decisions if you have more readability.

### Summary

So, what is enterprise sales in comparison to other types of sales? It can be riskier to sell enterprise software, as your sales reps may need to work harder to close enterprise deals. However, if your team is committed to the long-term success of the enterprise sales process, then the rewards can be enormous.

Enterprise software sales can be extremely lucrative for any software company if you tailor your sales tactics to solve the problems of each prospect and build meaningful relationships with them.

It can be a game-changer in terms of revenue and growth if your SaaS product can support enterprise customers. Even if your current sales model is a transactional or self-service model, you should seriously consider moving toward enterprise sales.

# What is Accredited Investor

## Not all investments are available to the general public. Access to higher-risk investments, such as hedge funds or venture capital, is granted to a special category of investors.

Under financial regulation laws, this category is referred to as **accredited investors.**

### Accredited Investor Definition

In general, the term accredited investor comprises investors that have the financial and business knowledge to assess the potential benefits and risks of more complex and higher-risk investments, but also possess sufficient finances to absorb losses that such investments can bring about. 

As the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins/updated-3) explains:

“One reason these offerings are limited to accredited investors is to ensure that all participating investors are financially sophisticated and able to fend for themselves or sustain the risk of loss, thus rendering unnecessary the protections that come from a registered offering”. 

In other words, regulatory authorities introduced the category of **accredited investors** in order to protect less knowledgeable investors from investments that may be too risky for them. Such investments include:

* Hedge funds;
* Venture capital;
* Angel investments;
* Private equity funds;
* And more.

### Accredited Investor Criteria

The criteria for being defined as an accredited investor are very stringent. In the US, in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an accredited investor is someone who:

* Has had an annual income of or over  $200,000 (or a joint income of at least  $300,000 together with their spouse) in each of the past two years and is expected to earn the same amount of income this year;
* Has a net worth of over  $1 million (whether alone or combined with the net worth of the spouse).

It’s worth mentioning that SEC expanded its understanding of the term accredited investor to include people who are considered **knowledgeable employees** of a private fund, as well as financial professionals possessing special financial securities licenses.

The above criteria refer to individuals, but it should be noted that institutions can also be accredited investors. This includes certain banks, trusts with assets exceeding $5 million, some loan and savings associations, etc. 

### Proof of Being an Accredited Investor

There is no formal process of becoming an accredited investor and hence no certification as such. It is the responsibility of companies that sell investments to accredited investors to check if they meet the above criteria.

Usually, these companies might require accredited investors to provide proof of their income and net worth, which can include financial statements, account information, balance sheets, and, in some cases, wage and tax statements, tax returns, and more.

### Summary

This article provides a brief overview of what it means to be an accredited investor, and what the specific requirements are for one to be granted this status.

While all investments carry a certain risk, there are those that carry higher risks and may require that investors possess more expertise and finances to handle losses. Accredited investors are those who are considered to fulfill the above criteria.

# What is Champion/Challenger Test?

## Businesses that compete with others to sell their products or services on the market often have to test their marketing strategies to increase their competitiveness and revenue.

One common testing technique these businesses perform is called [A/B or Split testing](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-ab-or-split-testing). Another important testing technique — especially prevalent with businesses in the [financial services](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030315/what-financial-services-sector.asp) industry — is the **Champion/Challenger Test.**

#### Definition

The Champion/Challenger Test is a testing approach for determining the best engagement strategy in a given market segment. When a business uses this approach, the **Champion** represents its current production or servicing paradigm while the **Challenger(s)** represents new or different ways of doing things.

Using Champion/Challenger testing helps companies in the process of making operational decisions — that is, decisions related to their everyday business activities.

Businesses across various sectors can use the Champion/Challenger test. This technique can be applied in areas such as [collections and recovery](https://community.fico.com/s/champion-challenger-collections-and-recovery), [decision automation](https://scorto.com/automated-lending-decision-software-champion-challenger/), and improving [customer experience](https://www.west.com/blog/interactive-services/champion-challenger-optimizations-2/) — to name only a few of its many potential uses.

#### Background

When it comes to testing marketing strategies, the Champion/Challenger Test is often compared to the more common A/B testing technique. A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method companies use to compare one version of the product or service they’re testing to another in order to systematically measure the success of each one of these versions and determine which one suits them best.

In this sense, the Champion/Challenger Test is similar to its A/B counterpart, in that it allows companies to try out and experiment with multiple operational decisions with the aim of comparing them since they can have different outcomes.

What distinguishes the Champion/Challenger Test approach from other similar tests, though, is the fact that it specifically distinguishes two kinds of strategy versions it tests against each other:

* A **Champion version**, which designates the company’s current production strategy, or business decision-making logic;
* One or multiple **Challenger versions**, representing different kinds of business logic and production strategies meant to compete with the company’s Champion paradigm.

#### How Does the Champion/Challenger Test Work?

This testing technique compares two or more operational decisions made through processing transactions and gives out requests to each of them at random in the decision service layer, much like A/B testing does. A significant upside of this technique is that it uses established mathematical and statistical algorithms to produce unbiased random requests when testing the different decisions.

After this process, the company’s operations team can tweak how the transactions are distributed through variant decision logic. The team can decide, for instance, that most everyday transactions should be processed in a particular way — which will be considered the Champion way — and the rest of the transactions, processed in another way, will make up the Challenge. They can then compare the outcome of both to determine whether the Challengers will do better than the determined Champion.

This kind of testing allows the operations team to control the exact number of transactions that are to be tested — as long as it’s two or more — but the particular transactions will be randomly picked. The Champion/Challenger Test picks the strategy to be compared and monitors the task to be able to properly measure how each party performs. You can track how well each strategy is performing and possibly shut down or tweak some experiments that are under-performing.

Another plus-side of the Champion/Challenger Test is that it allows the operations team to track the performance of each strategy in real-time. This allows them to make immediate evaluations of how well each decision performs, and close or modify under-performing experiments.

Through the distribution of requests with different versions of operational decisions, the Champion/Challenger Test helps companies determine the strategy that performs better than the rest in various aspects, such as execution speed, the impact of new revenue, new conversions made, and more.

#### Why the Champion/Challenger Test Is Important

Companies can make good use of the Champion/Challenger Test in situations where they need to review their current working model for one reason or another. If a particular company considers one or more different engagement strategies than the one it’s currently using, it will need to get an insight into how the performance levels of these Challenger strategies compare to that of their current Champion strategy.

It is often an established business practice for companies to use historical data on the new models they use to show how well they’re being implemented. However, these comparisons can’t be used to determine the business impact new models have — whereas the Champion/Challenger Test can.

To determine whether the company’s business approach produces offers that can really interest and attract customers, running the Champion/Challenger Test and measuring the outcome of old and new models can prove most useful. Deciding on things such as giving discounts to particular customers, offering them more bundling options, and more, can all be made easier by running the Champion/Challenger Test. Historical and test data by itself, on the other hand, cannot help companies with such decisions.

#### Summary

The Champion/Challenger Test is a testing technique used by companies to compare the performance of different operational decisions in production. It tests two different versions of strategies against each other — the Champion strategy, which represents a company’s current business approach, and one or more Challenger strategies, representing other approaches the company may consider.

This test is very similar to the more commonly used A/B (or Split) testing technique. Both techniques compare two different versions of an item in order to determine which one suits the testing company more.

The test effectively compares two (or more) competing logics of making decisions, created by processing transactions, by running them at the same time. In the decision service layer, the test assigns requests to each implementation randomly, using established mathematical and statistical algorithms to come up with unbiased random requests.

With the Champion/Challenger Test, a company’s operations team can track the performance of each competing strategy in real-time. This kind of testing helps companies get insight into the business impact their operational decisions have.

# What are Days to Term Sheet?

## Throughout their lifetime, businesses will often have to work with different kinds of documents that act as frames for their everyday work-related activities.

This includes everything from closing deals on selling products or services to bringing in investments, to any other kind of activity they engage in, especially with third parties. One such agreement, which is non-binding in nature, is the term sheet. When measuring how much time it takes them to sign a term sheet with a partner, businesses use a concept known as days to term sheet.

#### Definition 

Days to term sheet is a metric used by businesses when measuring how many days it takes them from the first contact they’ve had with a particular business partner — buyer, investor, etc. —  to signing a term sheet agreement with the same partner. 

Among businesses that practice signing term sheets, it’s generally considered that an average days to term sheet time equals 37 days — that is, that it takes businesses 37 days on average to sign a term sheet with a partner after first establishing contact with them.  

#### Term Sheet

Term sheets are documents that outline the basic terms and conditions of potential deals between businesses and their partners. Term sheets are non-binding and simply serve as templates for [legally binding documents](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/legally-binding-contracts.html). 

Upon mutual agreement from both parties on all the clauses laid out in the term sheet (commonly in the form of bullet points), they can then proceed to sign a final agreement, or contract, to seal the deal. This final agreement will essentially be a polished, legally binding version of the term sheet.

The basic function of a term sheet is to outline the most important features of a potential business agreement to be signed. The term sheet shouldn’t necessarily elaborate on every small detail that will be part of the legally binding future agreement. 

Simply put, term sheets serve the purpose of forming the basis for future cooperation between a business and its partners, buyers, or investors. These sheets are meant to make sure a basic agreement between the two parties when it comes to the most important aspects of the future deal and reduce the possibility of misunderstandings or disputes between them. Another important function of term sheets is to prevent the parties involved from prematurely incurring expenses stemming from the [legal charges](https://www.contractscounsel.com/b/cost-to-draft-legal-document) of drawing up legally binding business agreements. 

In this sense, term sheets are similar to other documents such as [letters of intent](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/gb/en/quick-guides/letters-of-intent) (LOIs) and [memorandums of understanding](https://www.stimmel-law.com/en/articles/memorandums-understanding-what-are-they-really) (MOUs). While all of these documents serve as preliminary drafts for agreement terms and conditions, they’re somewhat different from each other in some details such as the style they’re written in — term sheets being the least formal variant of all. 

#### Using Term Sheets for Investments

When it comes to purchases or subscriptions that necessitate contracts, term sheets can be signed between a seller and a buyer before the official contract is signed. However, term sheets are especially important when used to outline investment terms and conditions, more so than when used for regulating sales contracts.   

A typical term sheet that outlines investment conditions should cover aspects such as asset values, initial purchase prices (together with any factor that can potentially affect it), time frames for responding, and any other aspect relevant to both parties. 

It should be noted that investment-related term sheets are mostly used by startup businesses. It’s common practice for startups to try to attract investment through [venture capital](https://www.edupristine.com/blog/venture-capital) financing. Venture capitalists (VCs) are often on the lookout for the most successful startups (new ventures) to invest their capital in, relying on the foreseen success for these startups as an unofficial guarantee for the return of their investment.

Some common terms defined by startup investment term sheets include:

* **Valuation and dilution** — For startups, one of the most important aspects of a term sheet is the investor’s company valuation. A high or low evaluation can be a sign of how credible a particular investor is. The term sheet should also be very clear on aspects such as [anti-dilutive provisions](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/deals/anti-dilution-adjustment-clause/).
* **Voting rights** — Investors can often demand increased voting rights in startups they invest in as part of the deal, asking to have a say on issues such as particular sales, the possibility of demanding finances from other sources, and more. This is because investors want to make the most out of their investment, and can sometimes prove slightly inconvenient for startups that will often be pressured into giving up much of their influence over their own business in return for the investment they get. 
* **Liquidation preference** — This is a term that is related to the possibility of the startup’s liquidation, particularly referring to the potential of the startup’s founders selling their business to a third party. In this case, the liquidation preference term determines how much each party (investor and startup founders) will receive from the startup’s sale. 
* **Investor commitment** — With this term, the term sheet outlines a period during which the investor is obliged to keep investing in the startup.
* **Control** — In some cases, startups and investors also agree upon participation in the startup’s board of directors. It’s common practice in such cases that a board of 3 directors is formed within the startup, one director being an investor, and the other two being startup founders.

While the above list consists of the most common terms used in investment-related term sheets, there can also be other clauses outlining various agreements and obligations depending on the signatory parties. 

#### Summary

Days to term sheet is a metric through which businesses measure how many days it takes them from contacting a business partner to signing a term sheet with them. A period of 37 days to term sheet is commonly considered an average.

A term sheet is a document that outlines the terms and conditions of future deals between a business and its partners. Term sheets aren’t legally binding agreements, but rather serve as a basis for signing a future, finalized contract between the two parties that will legally bind them to the terms they both agree upon. As such, term sheets serve as templates for providing the final terms and conditions.

As such, term sheets are similar to documents such as letters of intent (LOIs) and memorandums of understanding (MOUs), differing mostly in the style they’re written in.

Term sheets are particularly important when outlining investment terms, especially for startups that mostly get investments through venture capital funding. Some common terms in startup term sheets include valuation/dilution, voting rights, liquidation preference, investor commitment, control, and more.

# What is a Buyer?

## For any business to succeed and grow, it needs to generate revenue. To do so, businesses engage in commercial activities — such as selling products or services — to buyers.

The role buyers play in this relationship is therefore at the center of the commercial existence of the businesses they’re dealing with.

### Definition

The term buyer refers to anyone that buys products or subscribes to services provided by a particular business. Companies can consider different kinds of entities, from individual persons to organizations (such as other companies, different legal bodies, and governments) as their buyers. 

Buyers are the ones that bring income (or revenue) to businesses and are crucial to them in this sense. No business can survive if it doesn’t have buyers to sell to.

### Buyers and Customers

In the vast majority of cases, a buyer means the same as a customer, which is a term more commonly used in business terminology. Because of this, in practice, the terms are used almost interchangeably.

Companies that do differentiate between these two usually do so to stress the kind of relationship they maintain with those who generate revenue for them. In this case, when using the term **buyers**, the emphasis is on the commercial exchange itself — doing one or more purchases is what defines the role of buyers. When talking about **customers**, on the other hand, the emphasis is on the continuous relationship they have with the company from all aspects, not limited to the commercial aspect of buying products and services. 

### Competing for Buyers

In the business sphere, many companies are vying for the attention of buyers, often in direct competition with each other. To this end, companies will often engage in different strategies that help them retain buyers, sometimes at the expense of competitor companies. These strategies can include:

* Aggressively advertising products and services that enables the selling company to reach more potential buyers;
* Making products and services cheaper, so that more potential buyers can afford them;
* Aiming to produce high-end products and services that will attract buyers through their sheer quality;
* Using creativity to come up with specific products and services that will target a [niche](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/niche-market-definition-for-business-2947188) audience consisting of particular buyers;
* [Negative advertising](https://blog.loomly.com/negative-advertising-definition/), where companies use campaigns to show their competitors in a negative light, hoping to take buyers away from them — a strategy that’s generally frowned upon;
* And more. 

### External vs. Internal Buyers

In business terminology, there are many ways to classify buyers. One of the most common classifications splits buyers according to their relationship to the business operations of the company they buy from, differentiating between external and internal buyers.

External buyers, according to this classification, are usually the most common kind of buyers the majority of companies sell to. These buyers aren’t related to the internal works of the company they buy from — they’re simply external individuals or organizations interested solely in buying the finalized products or services the particular company sells.

Internal buyers, on the other hand, have a direct relationship with the company and participate in its business operations in one way or another. These are often company employees, managers, or other kinds of groups within the company itself that buy its products or subscribe to its services.

### Understanding Buyers

As businesses need buyers to exist, they often develop strategies and plans on how to better approach them. 

Oftentimes, companies research their buyers’ backgrounds to obtain information that can help them improve their marketing strategy and reach out to other potential buyers more easily. 

During the analysis companies conduct to get to know their buyers better, they regularly split them into demographic groups, usually dividing them by age, gender, geographic area, median income, and so on. The knowledge of what groups of each category are most likely to provide them with buyers is something companies can use to develop an idea of what their regular customer looks like — and how to better target particular groups to increase their pool of buyers. 

Studying how their buyers behave in general is something companies often do. In fact, there are entire courses and subjects taught at colleges and universities that revolve around customer behaviors. These courses examine the reasons behind each purchase or commercial transaction a buyer engages in, and how the buying of particular goods and services can affect the companies selling them, as well as the economy in general. 

Companies will often go to great lengths to try to understand their buyers better, and understandably so. Knowledge about their buyers can help companies enhance their marketing and advertising strategies, adapt their products or services to the market demand, personalize their approach to attract their target audience, and create a lasting relationship with each buyer that is likely to turn them into a customer that will buy from them over and over again. 

All companies strive to adapt to the desires of their buyers as much as possible. Buyers who are content with the products or services they’re getting are beneficial for companies because they’ll likely keep buying from them, and possibly even recommend them to their peers. 

The importance of the feedback from buyers is what motivates companies to study their behaviors and analyze the relationships they develop with them in detail. This information helps companies improve their products and services to retain more buyers, and in turn, increase their revenue and maintain a successful business. 

### Summary

A buyer is anyone who buys products or services from a company. Any individual or organization can be a buyer. The term ‘buyer’ is often interchangeably used with ‘customer’, as these two mostly have the same meaning.

Companies often study the behavior and demographic background of their buyers to better understand them. This kind of information helps them enhance their business approach, which can, in turn, bring them even more buyers.

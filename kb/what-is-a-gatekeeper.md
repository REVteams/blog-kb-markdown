In many cases, in order to reach key decision-makers, salespersons will have to go through gatekeepers.

#### Definition

In sales terminology, the term gatekeeper is used to refer to a person — commonly a business employee — that stands between a salesperson and the key decision-makers they’re trying to reach to [close a sale](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal). Salespersons commonly encounter gatekeepers during [B2B](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2b) (business-to-business) sales. The gatekeeper is usually the first point of contact for salespersons reaching out to businesses they aim to sell to. 

#### The Importance of Gatekeepers

The concept of gatekeepers in sales is particularly significant, especially so in B2B. Sales professionals have to constantly work on improving their approach to communicating with different kinds of gatekeepers. Gaining experience and skills in gatekeeper interaction ultimately makes it more likely for salespersons to close deals.  

Business employees designated as gatekeepers, as this name itself suggests, are usually the ones that regulate which external parties can gain access to the business’ inner circles — thereby keeping the business’ gate. As businesses often get calls, emails, and even visits from unwanted third parties, gatekeepers are there to keep these parties out and ensure only those who can bring value to the business can be given an audience with its decision-makers.

In a company, the key decision-makers are commonly found among its [C-Suite executives](https://rev.team/kb/c-level-c-suite-executives). These executives are usually very busy with running the company and can’t always afford to talk directly to external parties trying to reach them, including salespersons working for other companies. For this reason, they usually have gatekeepers that help them save time by letting only the most relevant outside parties get in contact with them.

#### What Does a Gatekeeper Do

The employees that make up a company’s [first point of contact](https://snov.io/glossary/point-of-contact/) are usually also the ones that fulfill the role of gatekeepers. This can include employees such as receptionists, secretaries, [public relations managers](https://www.yourfreecareertest.com/public-relations-manager/), and the like. 

Gatekeepers screen any incoming call, visit, or email trying to reach key decision-makers within the company. More experienced gatekeepers are usually quicker to determine whether a caller or a visitor can bring value to the company or not, oftentimes intuitively. In most cases, gatekeepers dismiss any third party that doesn’t contact the company to either complain about or buy a product or service.

Given the nature of the role of gatekeepers, they find themselves at odds with external salespeople more often than not. The fact that many salespeople can be pushy or even manipulative when trying to get an audience with key decision-makers has earned them a somewhat bad reputation among gatekeepers. 

Because of this, it’s virtually considered a norm for a gatekeeper to have an amount of distrust towards external salespeople contacting their company. At the end of the day, gatekeepers who fail to do a good job at keeping unwanted external parties at bay risk straining their relationships with the company’s decision-maker who are usually their superiors. This means that gatekeepers often have a solid motivation to keep any potentially unwanted party out, which is why salespeople must take particular care when approaching them.

#### How to Reach Out to Gatekeepers

For salespersons, there isn’t a simple solution that will make gatekeepers (and, by extension, decision-makers) like them more. With that in mind, to increase their chances of closing a sale, experienced sales professionals are aware they have to use a respectful and professional approach when contacting their potential clients. 

As there are different kinds of gatekeepers depending on the type of sale, salespersons have to come up with different approaches to reach their key decision-makers through these gatekeepers. 

### B2B Gatekeepers

As stated above, gatekeepers are mostly found in B2B situations, where they’re usually employed by the business that a salesperson aims to sell to — commonly as receptionists, secretaries, or another similar function. 

Gatekeepers in such positions are usually the first point of contact, in charge of answering the phone, responding to emails, and any other task related to responding to external requests. As they’re less likely to influence the decision itself, experienced salespeople usually try to be as professional and nice to them as possible. The only thing such gatekeepers need to do for the salespeople is to get them an appointment with a decision-maker.

Another type of B2B gatekeeper is the assistant of a C-Suite executive. As these gatekeepers are different than the first point of contact type, experienced salespeople also use a different approach to them. Executive assistants do have a say (at least indirectly) in the purchase decision, as they often advise key decision-makers. Salespeople can afford to be a bit more aggressive with executive assistants — they usually aim to sell their idea to these gatekeepers first, so that they can then sell it to decision-makers. Even in this case, a step-by-step approach works best — for instance, the salesperson can describe the item they’re selling to the gatekeeper, and then say they’ll keep in touch and contact them again after some time.

### B2C Gatekeepers

Although gatekeepers are mostly present in B2B environments, there can also be [B2C](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2c) gatekeepers. However, in B2B, gatekeeping is mostly informal, and commonly done by family members or custodians of the decision-maker a salesperson is trying to sell to. This can include spouses, parents, or children of elderly people who might find themselves in the way of their purchasing decision.

These non-formal gatekeepers are to be compared to executive assistants, as since they can gatekeep for an individual, they can likely influence their decision as well. This means that they should be sold the idea of buying the product or service, too.

#### Summary

In sales terminology, a gatekeeper is a person that a sales professional has to go through to reach a decision-maker they can sell to. Gatekeepers are most commonly found in B2B sales.

Within companies, gatekeepers are employees that evaluate which external parties contacting them can gain an audience with decision-makers. As these decision-makers (commonly C-Suite executives) are usually very busy, they need gatekeepers to keep unwanted external parties from contacting them, thereby saving them time. 

Salespeople that want to get to decision-makers consider gatekeeper communication as a skill they need to perfect, since their chances of closing a deal improve the more skillful they are at this. However, for gatekeepers, anyone not contacting them for making a purchase or complaint is usually considered unwanted, which often puts them at odds with external salespeople in practice.

For this reason, salespeople have to be careful when approaching gatekeepers, and their approach should be different for each gatekeeper type. In B2B, the gatekeepers are usually first-point-of-contact employees, such as secretaries or receptionists. Executive assistants are another type of B2B gatekeepers that can influence the purchasing decision — salespeople will usually try to win them over and sell to them first so that they can then assist in selling to decision-makers. In B2C, on the other hand, the gatekeeping function is non-formal and usually assumed by a relative of the decision-maker. B2C gatekeepers also usually have a say in the purchasing decision, so they need to be won over by the salespeople.

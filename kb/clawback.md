# What is Clawback

## Companies usually expect all their employees to demonstrate a certain level of performance when working for them.

To this end, companies can employ a number of measures to motivate their employees in one way or another — including even punitive measures at times. One such measure, considered to be a controversial practice in corporate environments, is clawback.

#### Definition

The term clawback is used to designate any action, usually a contractual provision, involving an employer or benefactor taking back money already released to an employee or beneficiary. Clawbacks often include a fine when paid.

#### How Companies Use Clawbacks

When used, clawbacks are usually applied in employment agreements that include incentive-based payments such as bonuses, overtime pay, and so on. They’re mostly used as a punitive measure to be applied when employees or other beneficiaries underperform, break certain company rules, behave in an unacceptable manner, commit a crime or fraud, cause their company or benefactor to lose profit, or harm them in any other way.

In such cases, clawback clauses in agreements require the employee or beneficiary committing the infraction to pay a particular amount back. This amount could include just the incentive pay, the whole salary for a particular period during which they committed the infraction, and often even an additional fine.

The use of clawbacks, though present across industries, is especially characteristic of the [financial services](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/the-financial-services-industry-1287307) sector. In a majority of cases, when a company puts a clawback clause in their employment agreement — known as a **clawback provision** in financial terminology — this clause is not negotiable for the employee signing the agreement.

What makes a clawback different from a refund is that it is considered a punitive measure and it often includes an additional fine. This means that if a company concludes there’s a need for an employee to pay a clawback provision, this employee will often pay more than they received from their employers in the first place.

For companies, clawbacks represent a sort of guarantee for the performance and proper conduct of their employees. They use clawback provisions in their contracts to effectively control how well their employees do their work. The prospect of having to potentially pay the company a clawback provision should encourage employees to pay more attention to how they go about their daily assignments, and prevent them from misusing their position.

Because of the punitive element, clawbacks are considered a controversial method when employing. They are, however, important to a company that aims to build a trustworthy image of its performance and loyalty to its investors, and the community it works for in general.

#### Legal Background

Historically, even though it has existed for way longer, the practice of introducing clawback provisions to contracts became a popular measure after the 2008 world economic crisis. Since then, companies use clawback clauses much more often, aiming to prevent оr alleviate potential flaws by their workforce in the future.

After the crisis, clawback legislation got the attention of US authorities and regulators as well. In 2015, the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) introduced a clawback ruling under the [Dodd-Frank Act](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm), which obliges businesses to introduce clawback clauses in their agreements to prevent intentional over-reporting by their staff. Under this ruling, staff members that over-reported company profits can be asked to return bonuses or exercised stock options.

#### Where Are Clawbacks Used

Companies can include clawback clauses in their contracts in cases when they’re obliged to do so by law and when they aren’t, if they so choose, as long as federal legislation allows them to. Some of the most common areas where companies use clawback clauses include:

* **Medicaid recovery** — Through clawbacks, states can recover the costs of long-term healthcare expenses from deceased Medicaid users.
* **Executive pay agreements** — When employing new staff, a company can include things such as non-disclosure agreements and other similar demands from their employees in the contract as well as a clawback clause to enforce these. In case any employed executive breaks one or multiple of these clauses, especially if the executive is then employed by a competitor soon after leaving the company, the clawback clause can bind the executive to pay back a specific part of their salary and/or a fine.
* **Life insurance** — If life insurance users decide to cancel a policy they have previously been using, the insurance company that provided the policy can use a clawback clause in it to demand that they return the previously paid benefits they had received from this policy.
* **Mortgage lending** — Banks that give out loans to home buyers can include clawback clauses in their agreements to take the loan money back in case they deem the loan isn’t profitable for them. This usually happens when the buyers cannot manage to pay the interest rates.
* **Pensions** — Companies can include clawback clauses in their employees’ pension insurance contracts as well. In this way, a company can demand pension payments to be reimbursed to their account in case the pensioner has been found to have committed fraud or misused information.
* **Dividends** — In case money shortages occur in a financial project, companies can use clawback clauses in the project’s agreement to get dividends back. This kind of dividend clawback is applicable under very specific circumstances, usually in the case when one or multiple of the project’s investors file for bankruptcy.
* **Government contracts** — When the government assigns projects to private contractors, it can also use clawback clauses in the signed contract. In case a contractor doesn’t comply with a quality standard or fails to fulfill the contract in any other way, the government can claw back the funds it had previously assigned to this contractor for the project.
* **Prepaid commissions** — Sometimes, company contracts include prepaying defined amounts in commissions to their sales reps, instead of rewarding these commissions to the reps after they’ve reached the necessary sales targets. This is often done in jobs where deals have a high probability of closing. In case a particular representative doesn’t reach the minimum target that their prepaid commission entails, companies can use clawback clauses to prevent and/or alleviate the costs of failure.

#### Summary

Clawbacks are contractual provisions by employers or other benefactors, requiring their employees or beneficiaries to refund certain amounts (under specific conditions) they’ve received.

Clawbacks are a punitive measure and they often come with added fines that the employees or beneficiaries have to pay back in addition to the primary payments they received. As such, clawbacks are meant to deter employees or beneficiaries from fraudulent activities, unacceptable conduct, underperformance, or other kinds of activities that may harm their employers or beneficiaries or cause them to lose a part of their profits.

In most cases, clawback clauses apply to incentive-based payments such as bonuses or similar rewards.

Companies operating in the financial services sector are most likely to apply clawback provisions in their contracts. Clawbacks can also be used in other sectors, such as governmental contracts, pensions, Medicaid, and more.

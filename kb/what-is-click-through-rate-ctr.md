# What is Click-Through Rate (CTR)

## Nowadays, many companies base a big part of their marketing strategies on online advertising. Therefore, being able to measure the success of their online advertising campaigns is very important for these companies.

One important metric to use for this kind of measurement related to calculating online ad outreach is the click-through rate.

#### Definition

The term click-through rate, or CTR, refers to the number of clicks on a link (usually an ad) divided by the number of times the page containing the link is shown to its target audience. This metric is typically expressed as a percentage.

CTRs are used to determine how much a particular ad has managed to attract the attention of the end-users it targets — a high CTR means the ad was very good at attracting users, and vice versa.

Nowadays, due to the high volume of ads in the online sphere, a regular CTR for an ad is usually very low — often less than 1%.

Company ads are commonly displayed on websites owned by third parties. High CTR rates can be very beneficial for the websites that host the ads in question if they’re charging for them using the [pay-per-click](https://www.wordstream.com/pay-per-click-advertising) method.

#### Measuring CTR

When calculating the CTR of a particular online ad, companies need to first measure how many times end-users clicked on the ad link, and then divide this figure by the number of times this ad appeared to its general audience in total. To turn this into a percentage, the result is then multiplied by 100. The formula used to calculate a CTR looks like this:

**CTR = (Total measured clicks number / Total measured ad impressions number) x100**

To showcase a CTR with an example, let’s say that end-users have been shown a particular online ad **100,000** times in total. Out of this whole number, end-users have clicked on the ad’s link **500** times. To measure the CTR of this ad’s link, we divide 500 by 100,000 and then multiply the result by 100. The equation is, thus, as follows:

**(500 / 100,000) x 100 = 0.5%**

This means that the click-through rate for this particular ad is **0.5%**.

### Measuring the CTR of Email Campaigns

While calculating CTR as a percentage is by far the most common way of measuring the success of ads appearing on websites, when it comes to [email marketing](https://optinmonster.com/beginners-guide-to-email-marketing/), the approach to measuring the CTR of each email campaign is slightly different.

When companies advertise through sending personalized or cold emails, they don’t usually include ad links in the emails they send. Instead, they calculate how many times the recipients of their emails clicked on a link within these emails which led them to the company’s website, online product catalog, or any other end destination that’s relevant to their marketing campaign.

Email marketing CTRs can also be calculated by measuring the email links clicked as a percentage of emails sent, much in the same way the above equation explains it. It is, however, much simpler to measure this CTR as the total amount of times recipients have clicked on a company-related link from the emails they received — so many companies use this approach to measure the success of their email marketing campaign instead of calculating the CTR as a percentage.

#### Why Measuring CTR Is Important

Calculating CTRs allows a company’s marketing team to determine how efficient each one of their online marketing campaigns is, as part of measuring the overall performance of their marketing strategy. CTRs can be measured for various online marketing aspects, from email campaigns to ad impressions and paid promotions.

CTRs for different online ad characteristics can also help marketers improve the campaigns by evaluating their details. By determining which ads attract the highest numbers of clicks, marketers can determine which ad components are most successful in generating end-user interest, and vice versa — by determining which ad links don’t get clicked, they can see what doesn’t work and what shouldn’t be used in the future.

#### Shortcomings

While measuring CTR goes a long way in showing companies how effective their online advertising campaigns are and how they can improve them, the method is not without its flaws.

Most notably, CTRs can’t be used to determine why each end-user clicks on the online ad’s link. Knowing the motives of the target audience for clicking on ads can be very useful for companies that want to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the success of their campaigns, and measuring CTRs will not suffice in these cases.

Another shortcoming of CTRs is that, while they demonstrate the percentage of clicks an ad has generated, they can’t tell whether these clicks have ultimately led to sales. To determine this, companies have to measure additional parameters, such as conversion rates.

Despite all this, the method of measuring CTRs is very easy and convenient for companies and is therefore still widely used in practice.

#### Summary

A click-through rate, or CTR, is a metric used in marketing to calculate the percentage — or, in some cases, the number — of end-users targeted by online ads that end up clicking on the ad’s link.

Calculating CTRs helps companies determine how successful their online advertising campaigns are, as part of their overall marketing strategy. It also helps them fine-tune their strategy by focusing on those ad aspects that generate higher amounts of clicks while eliminating those advertising approaches that don’t.

Measuring CTRs has its shortcomings, though — it cannot determine the intent of the end-users clicking on an ad, nor how many ad clicks end up being converted into sales. However, because of its convenience, the CTR method is widely used.

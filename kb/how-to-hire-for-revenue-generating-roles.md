### What is a revenue-generating job role?

Sales and marketing are dead. It's all about the Revenue Team, or the roles within your organization that generate revenue. This includes more traditional sales roles that are responsible for selling products or services. It also includes positions that are responsible for retention and account growth. 

### Ways to Increase Team Building

As the person in charge of hiring for your organization, it is your job to share the roles you would like to fill. It is also your job to sell the candidates on your unique opportunity. 

Maybe you don't have the systems in place for training and onboarding new team members. Maybe you've had problems hiring for revenue-generating positions in the past. Maybe you've experienced a lack of involvement from new hires and as a result, suffered from high employee turnover. Revenue-Generating hiring must be done consistently, just like acquiring new customers.

12% - 20% of new hires stay in a position for less than a year. And it can be 2x as expensive to replace employees versus retaining the ones you have. To be successful with your hiring, you need a plan. You must have a goal, focus, and conscious effort every week.

Your job is to share the opportunity with others, encourage those who join, and give them a framework to build their career and experience with you. 

Each person must be connected to their own goals. They must also have the drive and desire for their goals to be achieved. Most importantly, they must *do the work.*

### 5 Tips to Improve Hiring for Revenue-Generating Roles

**1. Work on your mindset and mission.**
Be passionate about helping others. Work on improving your mindset, confidence, and other characteristics so you can become a great leader.

**2. Be consistent with sharing the opportunity.**
Remember your job is only to share the information and let others decide what to do with it. Detach from the outcome and stay focused on sharing the opportunity.

**3. Don't focus on the superstars.**
Most employees aren't A-Players. If you only plan to hire A-Players, you are making a huge mistake. You are building a company that depends on those A-Players to succeed. Instead, focus on hiring action-oriented, coachable B-Players and give them the skills they need to level up. 

**4. Share your opportunity in multiple ways.**
Don't just post the open position to your careers page, utilize videos, webinars, events, your newsletter, blog, etc. Get creative and get talking. 

**5. Be authentic in your messaging.**
Showcase the benefits, and share the value. Give glimpses into what it's like and how rewarding it is to be part of your team - share your story, your passion, your mission, and why you love it. Be authentic, be you.

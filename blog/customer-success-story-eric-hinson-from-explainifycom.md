Here’s Eric’s experience of working with REVteam, in his own words…

## Tell us about your company

My name is Eric Hinson and I run a company called [Explainify.](https://explainify.com/)

We help people distill their message down to the core story that they need to tell. We do that through animated video.

## What specific problem were you looking to solve, that led you to discover REVteam?

Multiple things. For us, we were building a sales team. We didn't have a sales team in place.

Then we were also looking at getting into digital marketing.

## What were the pain points of not having a solution to this problem?

We really wanted to push to the next level, but didn't have a good sales process in place, or a marketing plan.

REVteam came in and helped us with both.

The options were tremendous. There was conversion rate optimization, there was advertising, there was me trying to learn Facebook ads. There was, “Do I use HubSpot, do I use Drip, do I use 10,000 different softwares?”

Choosing REVteam really helped me hone in on this unique process.

## Did you have any doubts or concerns about working with REVteam?

There are always doubts and concerns, especially from me. I'm a doubter by nature. I would like data and facts.

But they just had this level of confidence in what they were doing, and they had good case studies, so it was really easy for me to make the decision.

## What was it like using the Fractional VP of Sales Service?

When I decided to work with REVteam, I had just hired a sales guy, but he wasn't truly a sales guy.

It was just a relationship oriented person that didn't believe he could do sales.

When we engaged with REVteam, they helped us use our own strengths.

We started with the coaching program but that succeeded and my internal employee got really good at sales.

Then we moved onto the VP of Sales side of the business, where Damian comes in for one day a week.

As I built a sales team, I found it more necessary to have that VP of Sales.

## When did you realize working with REVteam was producing results?

I think, for me, growing a business is quite a challenge. When I was able to bring Damian in as a VP of Sales, and use that service, it just completely alleviated my burden of having to manage a sales team.

For him to take over as the VP of Sales, and eliminate the stress that I had was just incredible. It really was a huge burden lifted and a relief for me.

I could focus on growing the business in other ways, that was really important for me and my unique abilities, to be focused on that, rather than leading a sales team.

## What were the big wins have you achieved by working with REVteam?

When I was able to focus on the other things that the business needed, and not so much the sales side, I was able to find more customers and grow the business from a biz dev and partnership, relationship, maybe strategic relationship aspect.

Damian taking over and doing that really alleviated me to be able to go do that as well.

My sales guy incrementally increased from when he started. It was a pretty crazy shift, because he went from being someone that didn't think he could be a sales guy to reaching our goals and closing the numbers that we needed to do. Which was quite impressive.

You know how in the sales and marketing books, there's about 80% fluff and there's 20% that is the really good content? When I talked to REVteam, that's how I felt - that they've really figured out the 20%.

There's just no fluff! There's so much fluff in the marketing and sales world. All these influencers on LinkedIn and all over.

I just really appreciate the direct approach. There's no BS. You just get to the meat of it and solve your problems and deal with it, and you learn to grow as a person.

## What would you say to someone thinking of working with REVteam?

We've had a lot of success. I can't recommend that team enough. They've just been so helpful for us.

Just have a conversation with them. I think immediately you'll understand how confident they are about what they do.

I would definitely make the jump. It's an investment that you can't afford not to make.

# What is a Lead Qualification?

## Consumers often find themselves reviewing multiple products and services that businesses offer with no real intention of buying. 

Not every lead that a business generates — that is, anyone that shows interest in a product or service that the business offers — is ready to actually make a purchase. That's where lead qualification comes into play. 

#### Definition

Lead qualification is the process of determining which leads have the highest chance to make a purchase from a business. This process is an essential part of the [sales funnel](https://keap.com/product/sales-funnel), as only a few of the leads that each business [generates](https://rev.team/kb/lead-generation) are usually qualified to [convert](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) to paying customers.

#### The Importance of Lead Qualification

Lead qualification is a crucial part of the sales strategy. This process helps businesses determine which prospects are worth their time and energy and are actually likely to be converted into customers.

However, it is one of the most ignored or incorrectly done processes when it comes to sales. There are [studies](https://www.business2community.com/b2b-marketing/15-need-to-know-lead-qualification-stats-for-b2b-marketers-with-takeaways-02073532) that point out that 61% of [B2B](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2b) marketers have issues generating high-quality leads, which leads to badly targeted sales efforts and lost time chasing uninterested, low-quality leads.

Without a lead qualification process, businesses will be forced to spend huge amounts of resources to potentially convert customers, while still being successful with only a few of them. The truth is, no matter how well businesses engage their prospects, no matter how much time and resources they spend on them, they simply won’t be able to convert them all. Therefore, unless they have unlimited resources in their marketing budgets, businesses would be wise to assess their leads by their likelihood to actually make a purchase.

#### How Lead Qualification Works

Lead qualification is a process consisting of a few steps. At first, a business’s marketing team collects information related to its leads through their inbound marketing operations and then assesses it against the customer profiles that fit the business’s target groups. If a lead fits the business’s [ideal customer profile](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-an-ideal-customer-profile-icp), they become a prospect.

The next step is making direct contact with the prospect, which is done by a sales representative with the idea to collect the final batch of information about them. This information includes their needs, buying schedule, [authority to make a purchase](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-decision-maker), and financial capabilities.

After direct contact has been established, sales representatives round up the process by determining whether the prospect is a qualified candidate for pursuing further interactions.

#### Sales Qualified Leads

A sales qualified lead is a prospect that has a high likelihood of completing a purchase. While this doesn’t mean that they’ll make a purchase as soon as possible, at some point in time, these prospects will likely be able and willing to do so.

Here, it’s important to note that qualified leads can get unqualified as well. There are many reasons why this might be the case, but some occur more often than others. Namely, a lead might really need a product or service, but they could be unprepared to make the purchase in a reasonable time frame. The product or service a business offers might also be way above their financial strength, and they might feel like it would be financially irresponsible to react to offers. There are times when leads get unqualified for not completely understanding the benefits and pros that a product or service offers or because of their uncertainty about how a business’s solutions can solve their problems.

Sales teams should be encouraged to make lead qualification a [data](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-data)-driven and quantitative process. This can be achieved by creating a score for each lead based on certain parameters and then assessing these scores through a given scoring model. Here, the parameters are related to the answers to the following questions:

* How often does each lead visit the business’s social media profiles?
* How often does each lead visit the business’s website?
* When is the leads’ last engagement with the business?
* What are the [click-through rates](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-click-through-rate-ctr) of the lead on the emails the business sends?

By using this scoring method, businesses have an easy way to determine their sales qualified leads. After this assessment, those leads that are considered unqualified should be removed, so that marketing teams don’t have to spend any more time or resources on them.

### How to Qualify a Sales Lead

In business, there can be many different types of leads. Some are really easy to qualify, whereas others require additional effort. When businesses encounter a lead that's hard to qualify, it's often wrong for the business’s team members to go with their gut feeling. Instead, businesses need to assume a more data-driven lead qualification approach. 

Some relatively well-known techniques that businesses use to distinguish between qualified and unqualified sales leads include BANT, CHAMP, MEDDIC, and ANUM.

#### BANT

The name BANT stands for Budget, Authority, Needs, and Timeline. This technique focuses on these four aspects, in order of importance:

1. **Budget**: Is a product or service affordable to the lead’s financial situation?
2. **Authority**: Does the lead have the authority to purchase the product/service, or is the purchasing decision in someone else's hands?
3. **Needs**: Does a product/service fulfill the needs of the lead, and how well? Are they just exploring their options or do they really need the solutions that the business can offer them?
4. **Timeline**: Is the lead really ready to make the purchase? Is the lead going to buy instantly, or is it going to happen some time in the future?

This technique is generally used by companies that sell rather expensive products/services. This means that not everyone is financially liable to acquire their solution, so they need to take that into consideration. This technique is often used in the B2B environment, where the decision-making authority is a very important part of the sales process.

#### CHAMP

CHAMP is an alternative methodology to BANT, and it's an acronym for Challenges, Authority, Money, and Prioritization. This methodology focuses on the challenges that a product has to overcome in order to satisfy the needs of the business’s leads. The CHAMP methodology starts from the point that a prospect’s purchasing timeline is determined by how much the prospect values acquiring the product or service that a business is selling.

#### MEDDIC

This lead qualification methodology is more complex than the abovementioned ones. However, its complexity also yields greater effectiveness. It focuses on a wide range of overlapping factors, including:

1. **Metrics**: What is the lead hoping to achieve through a business’s solution? Are they hoping for increased revenues, better customer targeting, or something similar that can be quantified?
2. **Economic buyer**: Does the business know who the person that makes the buying decisions is? If it doesn’t, it should try to find out.
3. **Decision criteria**: The business should be aware of the buying criteria of their leads. What exactly do the leads value in the product or service?
4. **Decision process**: What is the process that the lead goes through when deciding whether to buy a product or service?
5. **Pain point identification**: What exactly are the difficulties that leads face, and how can the business’s product/service help them with overcoming these difficulties?
6. **Champion effect**: Is there an employee of the company interested in the business’s products or services that could act as a champion, guiding their company towards making the decision to purchase?

Going through the MEDDIC lead qualification methodology requires lots of information. This methodology makes more sense for companies that sell low-volume and high-value products because they work on expensive projects with smaller numbers of [buyers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer), and can actually afford to invest the time to get to know the buyers better.

#### ANUM

ANUM stands for Authority, Need, Urgency, and Money, which, if read well, represent the same values as those of the BANT methodology, but in a different order of importance.

This methodology is usually used when a company negotiates with several buyers or groups and doesn’t have a clear idea of who the buying authority is. This is common for startup companies that still haven’t perfected the selling process.

#### FAINT

This is another spinoff of the BANT model, and the letters stand for Funds, Authority, Interest, Needs, and Timing. Unlike the BANT methodology, it also includes the interest factor, which means that businesses using this model focus on finding out how much their prospective buyers are interested in the products or services they’re selling.

The FAINT methodology is mostly used by companies dealing with leads that don’t necessarily know their products or services even exist. This usually includes leads such as those parts of the target audience that businesses reach out to through [cold calling](https://rev.team/kb/cold-call) or [cold emailing](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-cold-email). 

#### Summary

Lead Qualification is the process through which businesses identify the leads that are most interested in buying the products or services they offer. When done correctly, it helps businesses pursue only the leads that are likely to convert to paying customers, and saves them time and resources they’d otherwise likely waste on hesitant prospects that have a low chance of converting.

The lead qualification process consisting of a few steps begins by collecting information about leads, which is done by a business’s marketing team. This team then assesses this information against the business’s ideal customer profile, with those leads that fit this profile becoming prospects. From there on, the business’s sales representatives are tasked with making direct contact with the prospects. After gathering additional information, sales representatives will determine which leads are qualified and can be interacted with further.

A sales qualified lead is a prospect that has a high chance of buying a business’s product or service. To identify sales-qualified leads, businesses can use methodologies such as BANT, CHAMP, MEDDIC, ANUM, and FAINT.

# What is Cold Calling?

## Businesses develop different outreach strategies with the aim of increasing their sales and acquiring new customers or clients. One such strategy that has been around for some time is known as cold calling.

### Definition

A cold call is an attempt to engage a prospect who has no significant knowledge about or contact with the salesperson at the moment of receiving the call.

In most cases, the term refers to phone calls made by businesses targeting their leads or prospects, with the aim of establishing primary contact that will help them potentially conclude deals with these prospects in their future, converting them into customers. In some cases, however, it may also be used to describe personal visits to a target’s home, whether by a company or by another kind of organization that relies on this kind of outreach.

*Telemarketing is a common use of cold calling. It only has a 2% success rate, even for highly skilled professionals.*

Cold calling is disliked by consumers. Contrary to popular belief, cold calling is legal in the United States. Congress has passed laws that make it more difficult to cold-call on a large scale. There are laws and regulations in different countries that restrict cold calling, and you'll want to check the local laws in the specific area you're targeting before you get started.

#### Cold Calling vs Warm Calling

The term warm calling — as its name suggests — is the opposite of cold calling, and is used to refer to a type of outreach where businesses reach out to their leads, prospects, or any party they’ve already contacted before. Cold calling, on the other hand, means reaching out to targets with the business has never had a significant kind of contact before. This means that these targets don’t expect the business to call them.

However, businesses that do cold calls don’t randomly dial every phone number they can think of, hoping they’ll be lucky enough to get the attention of whoever is at the other end of the line. In fact, it’s quite the contrary — salespersons have to previously prepare a well-thought-out list of prospects from their database that are somewhat likely to be interested in cooperating with and eventually buying products or services from the business that contacts them. These prospects’ contact information could be acquired in various ways — from references, by them leaving their email address as part of online interaction, and so on — so they’ve somehow ended up as part of the company’s database without having previously been in contact with it.

### How Cold Calling Works

Cold calling is usually done via phone or telemarketing. However, it can also include in-person visits such as door-to-door salespeople.

Salespeople must be persistent and willing to endure rejections. They should do extensive research on the demographics and market of their prospects to ensure they are successful. Therefore, Revenue teams that rely heavily upon cold calling have a high rate of attrition.

Cold callers use a variety of techniques to get the attention of prospects. Some of these techniques include:

* **Researching their leads —** this includes accessing their lead database and analyzing as much information for each lead as they have, trying to figure out which ones are the most likely prospects.
* **Preparing a suitable introduction —** cold callers want to leave a good first impression, be catchy and not come off as too intrusive, which is something their prospects are usually very sensitive about.
* **Formulating a script for call outcomes —** as cold calls are unsolicited and the offers end up being ultimately rejected more often than not, companies that cold call needs to prepare for every possible scenario. The agents performing cold calls often follow elaborate scripts that tell them exactly how to behave in each situation, from prospects getting irritated by their call to actually showing genuine interest in the offer.
* **Knowing when to listen —** cold callers have to do the talking only to the point where they manage to get the interest of their prospects. A successful cold call is always preceded by an interaction where prospects start asking questions about the offer, which means cold callers should also be attentive listeners and ready to provide any information when asked.
* **Patience —** cold callers should never be put off by their prospects’ lack of interest, indecisiveness, or even rudeness, which are often the result of the fact the calls are unsolicited. A friendly approach (even when it’s not reciprocated), persistence, and patience are key features of successful cold callers.

#### Advantages

Before they cold call them, businesses have to research their prospects’ backgrounds and personalize their approach accordingly. It’s much easier for prospects to relate to the call when they feel that what they hear is relevant to them and they can establish a personal connection to their caller.

The direct contact aspect of cold calling is another huge advantage. While leads that are interested in information about a business can also ask for it via email, talking on the phone with an inside person is much more helpful and informative, which in turn makes it easier to convert prospects and leads into customers.

Calls also make it easier to arrange further interactions with the prospect in question. When receiving an unsolicited phone call, not every prospect can decide on whether they want to take their callers up on their offer. Oftentimes, prospects will need time to decide how to proceed — during the call itself, cold callers can easily arrange another phone call or even a meeting with them.

#### Disadvantages

Cold calling success rates are often estimated to be very low — around [2.5](https://www.leadfeeder.com/blog/cold-calling-is-dead/) percent according to certain studies. For this reason, many businesses have given up on them, though some who have enough resources still use them to gain new customers.

Cold calling can generate a variety of responses from consumers, including acceptance, hang-ups or terminations, verbal attacks, and even verbal attacks.

A 2020 LinkedIn report found that 69% of prospects had accepted calls from a new salesperson within the past year; 82% of the group was willing to meet. The seller's persistence is what determines the success rate.

It takes an average of 18 calls to connect with a buyer. Most sellers give up after four calls and never get a "yes." LinkedIn reported on a study by Rain Group, which surveyed buyers in 2019. A warm-call salesperson can boast a higher success rate.

Cold calling is becoming less popular with the advancements in technology. There are many newer and more effective prospecting methods available, including email, SMS, and social media marketing via outlets like Facebook and Twitter. These new methods are often more effective than making cold calls to generate leads.

Robotic dialing (or robocalling) is an innovation in cold calling. It uses algorithms to automatically dial and produce prerecorded messages. Cold callers have had to reduce their efforts to reach potential clients en masse because of government regulations such as the National Do Not Call Registry.

Cold calling is a common method of defrauding people, too.

#### Examples of Cold Calling

Cold calling is a common method for brokers to find new clients in the finance industry. Take the movie *Boiler Room*, in which a room full of stockbrokers calls names from paper lists to pitch obscure stocks.

Brokers receive more rejections than they accept. Cold calling is not a method that can secure lucrative deals.

Some brands are well-known for their door-to-door operations. Southwestern Advantage, a publisher of educational books, uses mostly college students to canvass residential areas. Kirby Company also sends its salespeople door-to-door selling high-end vacuum cleaners for homeowners.

### Best Practices for Opening a Cold Call

#### 1. Greet Them

Although greetings are essential in all calls, it is surprising how many salespeople forget to do it. You must greet the person on the other side of the call whether you are selling B2B or B2C.

Be respectful and professional. Formal greetings are preferable.

*([Source](https://salesblink.io/blog/best-cold-call-opening-lines))*

#### 2. Properly Introduce Yourself (and your Company too!)

You must make the call so engaging that they don't want to hang up. Here's where you can start:

> *"I am [Your Name], the [Job Title] of [Company]. We are interested in helping small businesses like yours grow."*

Focus on the benefits that your customer will get from what you offer. If they feel that there is something for them, they will be more inclined to keep in touch with you.

#### 3. Thank Them for Their Time

![Best-Cold-Call-Opening-Lines-Basics3-SalesBlink-1024x536](./img/Best-Cold-Call-Opening-Lines-Basics3-SalesBlink-1024x536.jpeg)

*([Source](https://salesblink.io/blog/best-cold-call-opening-lines))*

Encourage prospects to stay on the phone by thanking them for taking the time to speak with you. Always be honest about how much time your call is going to take. Here are is something you can say:

> *"Thank you for answering my call. Can I have 7 minutes of your time to let you know why I called?"*

If you make the prospect feel important and valued they might be willing to listen to what you have to say.

### Increasing Conversion Rates with Opening Lines

#### It's all about THEM. Address THEIR problems.

> *"Hi [Prospect Name], I'm Hillary Holmes from [Company]. I see your department is looking to improve the outreach skills of your sales team. Can you help me better understand why this is important to YOU?"*

On occasion, you will get a negative response. To prevent this from happening often, be sure to address their problem and focus on THEM. Never lie to the prospect about why you called or how much time you need. Opening lines provide the opportunity to build a strong foundation of trust.

#### Use a Referral.

> *"Hi, I'm [Your Name] from [Company Name]. [Referral's Name] with[Referral's Company] mentioned that I should call you in connection with how our company helped him in [Common Pain Point].<br><br>If you feel it is a good opportunity to speak to you, could I ask some questions to find out how our solution might be beneficial to your business?"*

This conversation mentions a mutual contact. It is easy to guess that a referral will increase your chances of getting the prospect's attention.

#### Experience with Competitors.

> *"Hi, [Prospect's Name], I'm [Your Name] here with [Your Company]. I am calling you because we have helped [Competitor 1's Name], [Competitor 2's Name], and [Competitor 3's Name], to overcome[Common Pain Point] and provided them with benefits."*

It is human nature to find out what your competitors are doing. The prospect is likely to join the race.

#### Acknowledge the Interruption.

> *"Hi, [Prospect's Name], I'm [Your Name] here with [Your Company]. I know this is an interruption but can I have 27 seconds to tell you why I called?*

If you acknowledge how you interrupted them, it shows that you are empathic, and the prospect will appreciate you doing so.

What you say is just as important as *how you say it.* You can tell them to let you know that they are busy right now. But before you hang up, be sure to reschedule a time that is good for *THEM*.

#### Ask Them For Help.

> *"Hi, [Prospect's Name], I'm [Your Name] here with [Your Company]. I was wondering if there were any ways you could help me."*

It is part of human nature to want to help others, asking for help increases their engagement.

Once you have gained their attention, you can thank them and begin to discuss their problems. Here's how to do it after they give you the nod.

> *"Great, thanks! [Prospect's Name], what is the greatest challenge that you face in your job in regards to [Benefit of your Product] because most people in your position have difficulty with [Common Pain Point]."*

#### Intrigue Them.

> *"Hello, [Prospect's Name], I'm [Your Name] here with [Your Company's Name]. I'm a little lost. Are you able to spare 6 minutes so I can explain why I called?"*

You are enticing them and pulling them in by asking them for their help.

#### Be Honest.

> *"Hello, [Prospect's Name], I'm [Your Name] here with [Your Company]. We have never spoken before."*

It is a great way to build trust and allow you to get to the heart of your call.

### Opening Line Best Practices

#### 1. Pay attention to the tone of your voice.

Cold calling is ALL about your voice. What you feel and what the other person hears will be reflected in your tone. Your voice should reflect your enthusiasm for what you do and your desire to help.

Listen to call recordings to study your voice and practice tonal emphasis in order to convey your message better.

#### 2. Keep an eye on your pace.

It can be nerve-racking when calling someone you don't know. Nervousness can cause you to speak too fast. This can happen subtly where you may not even be aware it is happening. It is a good idea to slow down and make sure the prospect understands what you are saying.

#### 3. Be human.

When you want to build a relationship, demonstrate your humanity. This can be done by sharing humor or being empathetic. You should ALWAYS admit if you make a mistake on the call. Calling out your own mistakes is another opportunity to build trust.

Being human can help prospects relate to you better. Perhaps that is why, even in the age of automation, cold calling is still made done by humans.

#### 4. Don't show weakness

Never ask for forgiveness because you made the call.

### Other Useful Cold Calling Tips

**Spend as much time as possible with them.**

Successful cold calls take more time than unsuccessful ones. The length of the call determines how likely you are to continue the conversation and keep the prospect's attention.

**Do your research.**

Gather as much information as possible on the prospect before the call. This will show them you've invested time to get to know them.

Show your prospect you care, show them that you know what their company does. Your effort to personalize the call will lead to  more success. Keep your research top of mind.

**Call at the right time.**

You can't just pick up the phone and dial any number you like. You must choose the best time to call. Prospects will be more likely to answer the phone if they are available. Your impact will be greater if you reach them at the right moment.

Plan your calls at the most convenient times of the day so you have time to complete other tasks such as reviewing your script and planning for calls.

**Be customer-centric.**

Reaching out to prospects should be a way to make sure you are focusing on them and not yourself. Do not start talking about your company or what you do. Nobody cares. This call is all about *THEM*.

Grab their attention by focusing on their pain points. You need to fully understand their needs before you can consider if they are a good fit.

**Prepare for rejection.**

Not all calls will result in a deal. Sometimes you won't be able to reach the person to speak with them. This shouldn't be a reason to give up. You keep trying and only remove them from your list when you've spoken and have gotten a "no".

It's important to remember that you are not the only one who is facing rejection. In this profession, everyone has experienced some form of rejection. You are not alone. *Keep trying*.

**Imagine yourself in their shoes.**

If you want to master the art of cold calling, you must put yourself in the shoes of your prospect. How would you feel if you received a cold call from someone? What tone would you choose?

Would you like the person to call you by your first name, or full name? What amount of time would you prefer the person to take to get to the point? These questions will help you determine how to present yourself to prospects when making calls.

Rule of thumb: be polite, courteous, understanding, and professional at all times during the call.

**Voicemail or Not to Voicemail?**

Sometimes, you may have to leave a voicemail when the prospect is not available. Don't be disappointed if this happens. Keep it simple and to the point.

You should have energy and leave callback information. Be prepared to follow up on your own even if you left a voice message.

**Follow up.**

One call will not guarantee you great results. Follow-up is key. You MUST follow up.

They may not agree to anything immediately. There is also a chance that the person you have just contacted may not be the decision-maker. When this happens, you will need to find out who the decision-maker is and get in touch with them.

Meaning...you *must follow up*.

### Summary

The term cold call is used to describe an effort made by a business (or any other organization) to directly reach out to prospects they’ve had no significant contact with before. Cold callers engage these prospects with the aim of potential future cooperation and eventually closing sales with them.

The opposite of cold calling is warm calling. This is a method where organizations reach out to prospects they’ve previously contacted in some way.

Cold callers don’t randomly reach out to anyone they can get — on the contrary, they often do research on those uncontacted leads that are most likely to develop an interest in their offer. Successful cold callers use a variety of methods to convert prospects into customers, such as preparing openings, formulating outcome scripts, being attentive and allowing their prospects to ask questions, and more.

The cold calling method has several advantages, including its personalization, which makes prospects feel connected to their callers, the direct contact, which facilitates the sharing of information and enables both parties to arrange for further calls or meetings in the likely event of the prospect being indecisive, and more.

Despite all this, cold calling remains a largely unpopular method nowadays. The success rates of cold calling are very low — just above 2% according to estimates. This is because cold calls are unsolicited and there is no guarantee prospects will be interested at all. Salespersons often dismiss this approach because it takes too much time and energy. More effective internet prospecting campaigns, such as cold emailing, paid ads, and social media promotions, are also making cold calling increasingly redundant.

From a financial aspect, when it comes to measuring earnings, making budgets, and reporting on finances, one significant point of reference for these organizations is the time period known as a fiscal year. 

#### Definition

A fiscal year, sometimes called a financial year or a budget year, is a 12 month period used by organizations — including businesses, governmental bodies, and nonprofits, among others — to denote the beginning and end of a year’s worth of financial activity. The fiscal year period is especially significant for accountants, for the purpose of budgeting, and particularly for the process of filing financial reports.

#### Fiscal Year vs. Calendar Year

For a great number of businesses, the fiscal year overlaps with the calendar year — that is, their fiscal year starts on January 1st and ends on December 31st each year. However, a variety of organizations don’t follow this schedule.

For business cycle purposes, some businesses have a fiscal year that’s different from the calendar year. For example, a retail company that mostly focuses on seasonal sales will often have its end-of-year (EOY) date for its fiscal year at the end of the last month of the season in question. Let’s say that this company does most of its sales during the holiday season, around the new year period. As the holiday season is considered to run until early January, this means that this retail company will commonly set the end of its fiscal year on January 31st, and the beginning of the next one on February 1st. Having December 31st as an end date to the fiscal year would mean that this company would have to file financial reports, do budgeting, and make preparations for the next fiscal year at a very busy period when it should be focusing on selling and [closing deals](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal) instead. Similarly to this, a company that does most of its sales during the summer period will usually end its fiscal year on August 31st or September 30th and begin the next one on September 1st or October 1st. 

Governmental organizations can also commonly use a fiscal year different from the calendar year. The U.S. federal government, for instance, uses a fiscal year starting on October 1st and ending on September 30th each year. Many businesses that mostly deal in governmental contracts are likely to use the same fiscal year, in accordance with the government finalizing projects and disclosing budget plans at this period. 

Non-profit organizations in the U.S., on the other hand, usually practice setting the beginning of their fiscal year on July 1st, and its ending on June 30th, accordingly.

When it comes to tax-related obligations such as reporting taxes in the U.S., some businesses can also opt for having their tax year coincide with their fiscal year rather than with the calendar year. To do so, these businesses have to file [form 1128](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1128) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). With this in mind, it’s important to note that the IRS has strict rules that aim to prevent the misuse of year-end changes as a means of manipulating tax payment timing by organizations.

### How Are Fiscal Years Referenced

The fact that a fiscal year may not always coincide with a calendar year means that there are special considerations when determining how the fiscal year should be referred to. By law, an ongoing fiscal year is referred to by the calendar year in which it has its end date. 

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a company’s fiscal year begins on September 1st and ends on August 30th every year. This means that the company’s fiscal year 2022, for instance, begins on September 1st, 2021, and ends on August 30th, 2022. If this company makes a commercial transaction on December 5th, 2021, for instance, this transaction will be considered a part of its fiscal year 2022.

#### Why Are Fiscal Years Important

The fiscal year is the basis for financial reports by businesses. In the U.S., accountants working for organizations have to file their [financial statements](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsbegfinstmtguidehtm.html) to the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) by the end of the fiscal year. The records needed for compiling financial statements are found in the accounting books that businesses keep. In cases where businesses decide to use a fiscal year for reporting federal tax, the end of the fiscal year is also a significant deadline for accountants. 

A fiscal year is particularly significant to publicly traded companies — that is, companies whose equity can be openly traded on a stock exchange or in over-the-counter markets. Publicly traded companies measure their revenue and earnings on the basis of fiscal years. Through this practice, they can compare their success in earning revenue for each passing year. Making such comparisons is especially important for business analysts as well as investors, who tend to compare the performance of these companies before deciding to invest in them. 

Fiscal years are a common point of reference for businesses, governmental and non-profit organizations alike when they’re in the process of formulating their budgets. Organizations commonly analyze their budgets for each passing fiscal year as it’s about to end. On the basis of this analysis, they come up with new budgets for the next fiscal year, having their business needs and objectives in mind while doing so.

#### Summary

A fiscal year is a 12 month period used by organizations such as businesses, governments, and nonprofits, as the point-of-reference period their yearly financial activity revolves around. Fiscals years are commonly used in accounting, for preparing yearly budgets, measuring earnings, and filing financial reports.

In many cases, the fiscal year of organizations coincides with the calendar year, which means it starts on January 1st and ends on December 31st. However, some businesses use a fiscal year different from the calendar year for business cycle purposes. This is often the case with seasonal businesses which will often set the end of the last month of their busiest season as the end of their fiscal year. 

Governmental bodies often use a fiscal year that’s different than the calendar year, too. Notably, the U.S. government uses a fiscal year that starts on October 1st and ends on September 30th each year. Nonprofits in the U.S., on the other hand, will commonly use a fiscal year that starts on July 1st and ends on June 30th.

Fiscal years are referenced by the calendar year in which they have their end date. This means that a company’s fiscal year starting on September 1st, 2021, and ending on August 30th, 2022, will be considered the company’s fiscal year 2022.

Fiscal years are significant as time periods for which accountants have to file financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) each year. Publicly traded companies evaluate their revenues and earnings for each fiscal year as well. What’s more, all businesses, governmental and non-profit organizations use the fiscal year as a period of reference when budgeting, as they often compare their budgets for the passing fiscal year as they formulate budgets for the new one.

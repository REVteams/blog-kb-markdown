# What is Base Salary

## Employers can pay their employees different kinds of compensation for their work. In the vast majority of cases, compensation comes in the form of a salary.

With that being said, there are different kinds of calculating salaries as well. The most visible part of a salary — and the one employers usually discuss when recruiting new employees — is the base salary.

### Definition

Base salary, also known as base pay, is a term used for the initial, fixed amount an employer pays their employees for their work, without taking into consideration the additional costs that may go hand in hand with the employment procedure.

The additional costs that aren’t considered part of the base salary usually include paid benefits (such as health insurance, retirement pay, etc.), stock options, raises, or bonuses the employee may be getting from the employer.

For a base salary, employers expect their employees to perform a standard amount of work for them, which varies depending on several factors, such as the nature of the employer’s business, the position itself, etc. It is generally accepted as a rule that employees should work a minimum of 40 hours a week for the base salary an employer is offering them.

Employers present base salaries as rates on the basis of time intervals. As such, when engaging new employees, employers usually discuss their base pay in terms of a weekly, monthly, or annual base salary.

### How Employers Pay Base Salaries

To come up with a base salary for each position, employers must take several factors into account, such as:

* How many people who are able to do the work are available on the marketplace, at that particular moment, for the employers. If the number of qualified potential employees is low, demand for them will rise, and as a consequence, employers will have to offer them a bigger base salary with the hope of hiring them. In the opposite case, if this number is high, base salaries will usually be lower.
* The amounts employees are usually paid for the same (or similar) positions by other businesses across the marketplace. This can be measured on a regional, national or international level, whichever is most relevant to the nature of the work. Most commonly, however, companies compare the base salaries for the same work in their immediate region or the city they’re based in.
* The employers’ individual budgets and the amounts they can allocate for hiring employees for each particular position.

As base salaries vary across industries, individual employers, and separate positions, the way they’re paid can also be different, usually from employer to employer. Most commonly, employers pay base salaries at predetermined time intervals, usually monthly or every two weeks, but this can largely depend on the contract.

### Base vs. Gross vs. Net Salary

A base salary constitutes the bare minimum an employee can expect to get for working for their employer. As such, base salary is commonly complemented by additional compensations in the form of benefits, taxes, and extra payments, some or all of which employees pay for on top of the base salary. Together with the base pay, all of these additional compensations constitute an employee’s [gross salary](https://www.coverfox.com/personal-finance/tax/gross-salary/).

When benefits and tax are subtracted from the gross salary, the employee is paid a [net salary](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/12/net-salary). This kind of salary is also to be distinguished from the base salary. In fact, net salary is made up of the base salary, plus all the monetary compensation an employee actually takes home, such as bonuses, raises, overtime payment, and other compensations that go directly into the employee’s pockets.

Net and gross salaries are commonly calculated yearly, making up an employee’s [annual salary](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/real-money-talk/what-is-annual-income-765/), or annual income.

### Summary

The term base salary or base pay refers to a minimum amount that employers pay their employees for the work they perform for them. An employee’s base salary doesn’t include benefits, extras, or any kind of additional compensation they may get from their employers.

When determining base salaries, employers must have multiple factors in mind, such as their own budgets, the availability of potential employees on the marketplace, how much other employers pay the same job, and so on.

Employers typically pay base salaries at regular, predetermined time intervals, usually every two weeks or every month.

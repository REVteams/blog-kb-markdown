# Account Executive (AE)

Account Executive (AE)

In business terminology, the term account is often used to designate a business relationship between two parties where one of them is referred to as the account of the other.

In this sense, it is important for companies to take care of their accounts, and for this reason, they can have a number of employees working on account relationships. One such position is that of an account executive or AE.

## Definition

Account executives are salespersons that work in a company’s marketing, advertising, and finance departments. Their position within a company largely consists of taking care of existing client accounts and serving their needs. They are usually tasked with making sales and closing deals with existing client accounts, in order to make room for new ones.

The position of an account executive (AE) is similar to that of account development representatives (ADRs) in the sense that their work revolves around maintaining accounts. However, while the ADR’s main focus is to provide value to the client relationship in all of its aspects, sometimes even sacrificing the company’s short-term earnings and profits in order to improve the long-term bond it has with its accounts, the AE focuses on the sales aspect instead. AEs specialize in closing deals with clients, rather than fully managing long-term customer relationships, which is more of a job for ADRs.

AEs aren’t the same as sales representatives, either. While salespersons usually just sell to clients without treating account relationships, AEs do pay attention to maintaining, supporting, and enhancing accounts even after closing deals with them. The exact amount of post-deal account engagement of AEs can vary, though, so in most cases, they work alongside ADRs in this area.

## Requirements

To become an AE within a company, one should have some experience in similar positions. This would normally include sales representatives, account managers, marketing agents, and more.

In terms of education requirements, there aren’t really any specific studies that produce AEs exclusively. There are, however, several areas of higher education that most AEs have graduated in. These would include marketing, communications, business administration, and similar ones.

Oftentimes, companies that already have AEs assign junior AEs to them when they want to expand the team. Junior AEs learn the ropes by assisting their senior counterparts, working together with them to help them acquire new accounts and maintain old ones.

## What Does an AE Do?

AEs work directly with clients to take care of their needs and provide them with services. To this end, they can be assigned a number of tasks, depending on the industry their company’s working in. They usually take on duties such as:

* Mediating processes and interactions between their company and the clients.
* Taking care of the clients’ professional needs by coming up with proper solutions to their requests and problems.
* Monitoring and planning account-related activities.
* Helping the company expand their account relationship by identifying each client’s key business moments as they happen, and utilizing them in a way that will help broaden the cooperation between the two parties.
* Trying to prevent competitors from reaching out to the company’s accounts, by identifying the clients’ “weak spots” that the competition might take advantage of.
* Reporting on all account-related information to the company.
* Going to regular meetings and coordinating directly with clients.
* Keeping track of marketing trends and conditions in order to come up with appropriate marketing strategies and sales objectives.
* Doing market research to generate leads and potential new clients.
* Ensuring the clients’ satisfaction by proactively asking them for feedback, and creating a plan for the company to properly respond to it by modifying its way of work to suit the clients’ best interests wherever possible.
* Creating account and marketing strategies for the company, making the best possible use of all platforms where they can promote it in order to gain new clients.
* Maintaining existing clients by coming up with strategies to have them continuously buy products and services from the company.
* Assessing data relevant to the industry they work in, in order to help the company base its decisions on sound business analysis.
* Constantly communicating and negotiating with clients in order to close better deals and develop more opportunities with them.
* Working with new candidates to help them improve their knowledge and gain experience in sales and account maintenance.
* Managing teams of quality leads that help the company grow its network of connections.
* Cooperating with the company’s different marketing and production departments to help them plan sales and product placement.
* And more.

Coordinating the many different aspects of a company’s account, sales and relationship-wise is a serious task. AEs’ [median salary](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/alternate/account-executive-salary) reflects the dedication required for an engagement of this scope.

## Skills

The extensive list of tasks AEs take upon themselves requires much in terms of skills and experience. Usually, a company’s AE has to:

* **Be experienced with sales** — AEs must already have a grasp of how sales work since their main goal within a company will usually be to close new deals.
* **Be adept at communicating and negotiating** — Closing good deals and contracts will often require negotiating the price, which an AE should know how to do well. This goes hand in hand with their communication skills. AE's will spend most of their time in direct communication and negotiation with new and existing clients, and they should have the proper skills to make the most of this relationship.
* **Be a problem-solver** — Like the ones tasked with dealing with the accounts’ issues, AEs must take a proactive approach to find the best solutions to all problems that the company’s clients might find in the professional relationship.
* **Have project management skills** — Working with clients is a project in itself. AEs should be skilled in the art of monitoring and delivering task results the company has determined important to their account.
* **Have leadership skills** — Taking the initiative is a huge part of an AE’s work, especially for those in senior positions working in synergy with the company’s different teams and training junior AEs. Leadership skills are what make a seasoned AE, and they definitely come in handy for up-and-coming candidates for the position.
* **Have analytical skills** — AEs, in their cooperation with different sales teams, find analytical skills to be essential. They should know how to analyze the market for the purpose of increasing sales and finding new clients. This requires the ability to investigate and interpret information related to the sector they work in, measure the company’s performance, and set achievable goals for it.

Having skillful and experienced AEs is a huge asset to every company. Proactiveness and willingness to learn more about the clients and the market are essential for any candidate for an AE position.

## Summary

Account executives, or AEs, are specialized employees in a company, tasked with taking care of its clients’ needs and closing the best possible deals with them. They can often be recruited among salespersons and similar business professionals. An AE’s responsibilities often depend on the industry they work in and the clients they’re dealing with.

Hiring an AE is usually a large investment for companies. However, when they really need one, companies know how to value their AEs who will, in turn, also create value for them in the long run.

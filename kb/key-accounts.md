# Key Accounts

## To maintain a presence on the market and generate the revenue needed for growth, businesses need to engage in economic activities — that is, sell products and/or services to buyers.

Many successful businesses often refer to their recurring [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) as [accounts](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-account) — a term that designates a professional relationship between these two parties, which is of a certain level of interest for the seller to consider the buyer as their account. Such businesses often use the concept of key accounts to designate those accounts they consider to bring them more value than the others.  

#### Definition

In business terminology, the term key accounts is used to refer to those clients that are considered most important by a business’ salespersons and customer success agents, usually as a result of their increased contribution in purchases. Identifying key accounts is one of the most important strategic drivers of the company, and having such clients [churn](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-churn) is something most businesses want to avoid.

#### Background

There are many misconceptions about key accounts, a common one being the assumption that the accounts that make the largest purchases are their key accounts. Often, the largest accounts are the ones that somehow exploit the [economies of scale](https://www.thebalance.com/economies-of-scale-3305926) to their advantage, and use this as a bargaining point to create the illusion that businesses are dependent on them for revenue.

However, accounts that purchase the most aren’t necessarily key accounts for all businesses. Instead, for a business relationship to qualify as a potential key account, it usually needs to fulfill the following prerequisites:

* **Clients need to make repeat purchases from the supplier**. This means that in order for an account to qualify as a key account, it has to be willing to make continuous purchases and not settle for a one-buy deal.
* **The supplier and buyers both look for a partnership that will yield mutual benefits and profits.** In other words, key accounts are buyers that are willing to collaborate with their sellers in the long term and build a relationship that will benefit them both as time goes by.
* **The buyer should be interested in the premium variant of the offer, in order to get the maximum benefit from the seller.** This means that the buyer should recognize the benefits that the premium package offers, and be willing to use the easy access to innovations, discounts, and premium services offered by the seller. The buyer has to develop a consciousness that paying for the additional services is worth it, and they have to be ready to invest in it.
* **Key accounts work together with the seller in order to become more and more profitable and build more fruitful relationships with one another.** Having in mind that relations are built slowly, not all big accounts qualify as key accounts. A business relationship with a key account is characterized by mutual respect and a willingness to cooperate, and it yields the benefits of the collaboration.

#### How to Identify Key Accounts?

Businesses should be aware that not all accounts can qualify to become key accounts. Having this in mind will help them refrain from committing too much to accounts that cannot be converted into significant contributors, so they can focus their energy and resources on those that can. Ultimately, this approach will lead businesses to attain their desired return on investment.

To determine what accounts have the potential to be considered key accounts, a business needs to make a precise assessment and scoring of their clients, weigh out their beneficial traits and come up with a final score for every account. In the end, the clients with the best scores on this assessment will be likely to become the business’s key accounts.

The criteria for identifying key accounts are commonly separated into three categories: **growth**, **harmony**, and **value creation.**

### Growth

This category puts the clients on a corporate scope wherein businesses look for their economically beneficial traits. Businesses try to determine whether their clients are financially appealing and whether they can help them increase revenue and profits.

* **Potential for revenue** — Here, businesses try to answer questions such as whether their clients are big spenders, whether the client company is constantly climbing the economic ladder and growing for consecutive years, and whether they’re in a position to lure a future share of their clients’ finances.
* **Cost to serve** — Businesses also look for ways to reduce the cost of serving their customers, while still keeping the same (or higher) quality of services. This is a tough trade-off, but it's very important. If businesses find cheaper ways to service their buyers but reduce the quality of service, customers might become disappointed, which can ruin the relationship.
* **Stability is key** — Sales are just a fraction of the story. Businesses look for loyal buyers that constantly use their services, and even evolve their work processes to better fit the range of services they offer.
* **Access to new territories** — Businesses want to know whether their clients have an international presence, expand through acquisition, run diversified companies in the vertical sense, and most importantly, whether they can help them access new markets.

### Harmony

Businesses also need to know how well each buyer fits a solution they offer, how well they merge with their business strategies and company culture. Here, they focus on the following issues:

* **Client requirements of products and services** — Businesses want to know if their solutions fit their clients’ requirements better than the solutions of other suppliers. They need to satisfy their buyers, which is the foreground for building a strong relationship and a step towards making them key accounts.
* **Innovativeness** — It's very important to learn about the readiness of clients to dive into new technologies and innovative ideas. Here, businesses can use their clients’ help for future product development, or even make them beta testers and/or early adopters.
* **Benchmarking** — Companies that found a way to use the businesses’ solutions at a high level can be really valuable for further optimizing their products and services. They can also be a rich source of information from which businesses build their case studies and use cases.
* **Reputation in the corporate world** — The more well-known their customers are, the more trust businesses gain in the corporate world. Namely, if a strong and respected corporation is using and trusting a business’s products and services, the business can accumulate trust in the corporate world, which is a great way for it to earn new buyers.
* **The process of buying** — The power to influence and manage key accounts skyrockets with the ease of the buying process. The easier it is to acquire a business’ services and products, the easier it is to follow up with new ideas and offers to the buyers.

### Value Creation

Businesses benefit from clients that are willing to invest and build up a relationship with them. Therefore, they need to assess their clients by their willingness to adopt them as a strategic supplier. Here, they need to keep the following points in mind:

* **Strategic benefits** — The business needs to know if it can offer something to clients that will help them reach goals they wouldn't be able to reach without this kind of help. They also want to establish whether their clients can offer them something valuable in return.
* **Solidarity** — Another important thing for businesses to determine is the level of willingness of their clients to work with them to solve mutual problems. They want to know whether their clients understand the problems that might occur on both sides and whether they’re willing to sacrifice some comforts from time to time to help the other side get out of a bad situation.
* **Long-term vision** — Clients that have the right idea of building a long-term partnership are the ones businesses want to invest time and resources in. 
* **Planned behavior** — Businesses value clients that plan and work towards setting and achieving mutual goals, and giving honest feedback and opinions are the way to go.
* **Exchange of information** — Businesses can build better relationships with clients that are open and honest. Honest feedback can, in turn, help businesses gain insights into how to improve their rapport with other clients as well. 

#### Summary

A business’s key accounts are those clients that salespersons and customer success agents consider to be the most important ones, usually as a result of their increased contribution in purchases. Key account churn is something most businesses want to avoid.

Although it might seem that large accounts instantly qualify for key accounts, that is not always the case. There are other prerequisites that an account needs to fulfill in order to qualify as a key account, such as making repeat purchases, looking to build a mutually beneficial partnership with the business, being interested in premium features, and being cooperative.

Businesses use an assessment scale to determine who their key accounts will be. This scale is made up of parameters such as growth, harmony, and value creation. When businesses qualify their clients growth-wise, they aim to establish the potential for revenue, the cost of serving said clients, their loyalty and stability, and their potential. 

Businesses also need to establish how harmonized their clients are with their brand — that is, what they require of their products and/or services, how they can contribute with innovative ideas, whether they use their solutions as a benchmark, how reputable they are in the corporate world, and how easily they engage in buying. 

Lastly, businesses evaluate how much value clients create for them by calculating the strategic benefits of their relationship, determining whether they can solidarize to solve problems, measuring their long-term vision for the relationship, establishing whether they make plans on how to achieve mutual goals, and whether they can provide them with honest feedback.

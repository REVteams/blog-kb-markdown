#### Definition

Drip campaigns, also known as drip marketing or automated email campaigns, are a kind of marketing strategy used by businesses wherein they automatically send pre-written messages to their customers or prospects over time. As these messages are automated and commonly sent to each individual target at predetermined time intervals, the sending process is compared to dripping, which is why they’re called drip campaigns. 

#### How Drip Campaigns Work

There are several ways through which businesses can implement drip campaigns. Some of the most widely used channels through which drip campaign messages can be sent include:

* **Emails** — This method is by far the most dominant one when it comes to implementing drip campaigns. Email drip campaigns are used more often than other types of drip campaigning because sending large amounts of emails over several time intervals is the cheapest method of continuously messaging prospects and customers. This kind of drip campaign uses [autoresponders](https://support.3dcart.com/knowledgebase/article/View/450/11/how-do-the-autoresponders-work), which are computer programs that automatically send and respond to emails. 
* **Social media messages** — Most modern businesses have profiles on various different types of social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Linked In, and so on. Through these profiles, they can also send automated messages to their audience as part of drip campaigns. A common way to do so is by automating message responses and sending various kinds of discounts, promotions, and ads directly to users’ inboxes. 
* **Direct mail** — Some businesses also practice drip campaigning through [direct mail](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-direct-mail), that is, through traditional postal services. This method is used far less than online-based drip campaigns, mostly because it costs more to send physical mail to users.

#### How Businesses Use Drip Campaigns

Drip campaigns are a part of [direct marketing](https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/direct-marketing) campaigns. This means that through drip campaigns, businesses and their marketing teams contact their audiences directly without any advertising mediation. They’re also a type of [database marketing](https://clevertap.com/blog/database-marketing/), which means that they collect information about their users stored in a database. As such, drip campaigns are a common practice for businesses when generating leads.

Through drip campaigns, among other marketing techniques, businesses can also nurture their relationship with their leads. This, in turn, helps them turn their leads into customers more easily as their relationship deepens. 

For the most part, businesses use drip campaigns as a type of automated follow-up request from their prospects and leads. In this way, businesses practice a more non-personal method of getting follow-up feedback from their audience, which usually seems less intrusive than more traditional, personal follow-up methods.

Among the many uses for drip campaigns in marketing, some of the most common ones include:

* **Confirmations** — One way to use drip campaigns is to send confirmations to customers. Whether a user purchased a new product/service or renewed their old subscription, a business will often send them a purchase or renewal message, commonly in the form of an email, with relevant information such as a receipt, order number, and so on.
* **Expiry notifications** — When a user’s subscription is about to expire, or when it already has, businesses can send them automated drip campaign messages to remind them of the (pending) expiry. These messages often contain either a direct link or general directions instructing users on the possibility of renewal.  
* **Onboarding** — Businesses also use drip campaigns when attempting to onboard prospects and potential customers. When onboarding users, businesses offer them targeted goals they can fulfill which result in (or ultimately lead to) a sale. Such goals can include downloading a mobile app by the business, creating a user profile on its website, upgrading a subscription, taking advantage of a discount, and so on.
* **Welcoming** — Whether they recently got themselves a new customer, a newsletter subscriber, or a user simply made a profile on their website, businesses can use drip campaigns to send automated welcoming messages to users. A welcoming message sets the stage for the business to develop a good relationship with the user. 
* **Re-engaging users who abandon shopping carts** — Users can put many items in their online shopping cart while browsing the purchase section of a business’s website, or when they simply see a promotional “Add to Cart” button in one of their emails. In some cases, they can also forget to finalize some purchases of items in their carts. Therefore, businesses can use drip campaigns to remind users to finalize their checkout.  
* **Recommendations** — Businesses often collect information about their users’ preferences and purchasing habits. They can use this kind of information to recommend items that may be of interest to their users through a drip campaign.
* **Unsubscribes** — Even when a user unsubscribes from a newsletter or service usage, businesses can use drip campaigns to try and turn the situation to their advantage. Automated unsubscribe messages can serve as a final shot for businesses to try to re-engage leaving users and change their minds about abandoning their subscriptions. 
* **Sales** — This use for drip campaigns is overarching, as they are usually put in function to ultimately drive sales and increase profitability for businesses. Drip campaign marketing focuses specifically on maintaining a positive relationship with customers and prospects in order to make them more likely to [close deals](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal) with the business.
* And more.

The most notable advantage drip campaigns have over similar types of messaging marketing, such as newsletters, is that when a user subscribes to a newsletter they can’t see the previous editions sent before they subscribed. On the other hand, drip campaigns send messages to users following a predetermined course, which is determined by the personal information and status of each user.

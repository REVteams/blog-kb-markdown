Nowadays, when the internet is widely used throughout the world, a big part of the marketing campaigns of modern businesses take place online. However, some more traditional marketing methods still survive to this day. One such method is known as direct mail marketing.

#### Definition

Direct mail, also known as advertising mail, is a marketing technique wherein businesses and other organizations send their physical promotional material — such as pamphlets, brochures, catalogs, newsletters, and so on — to their target audience (mostly their prospects and [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client)) by post. The aim of direct mail marketing is to use the more traditional postal services to [convert](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) prospects into paying customers and generate further income by retaining existing customers and clients.

#### Why Is Direct Mail Marketing Important

Sending promotional mail through postal services is a practice that has been in use, in one way or another, for centuries. To this day, many different organizations, as well as businesses from multiple sectors, use this method to reach out to their target audiences.

Nowadays, more and more businesses tend to transfer their marketing campaigns entirely online. This brings them some specific benefits, but at the same time, it decreases the competition in direct marketing. This means that, for those businesses that still promote themselves through direct mail, it’s becoming easier to get noticed than before. Not everyone will read every piece of physical mail they get, but most people will at least superficially go through all of it — this provides an opportunity for creative direct mail marketers to attract their attention by using specific design patterns, colors, texts, and other elements that can make their promotional materials stand out.

With that in mind, even if the recipients of direct mail don’t immediately go and buy from or even contact the business that sent them promotional materials, many of them will still keep the materials at hand if they catch their eye. This can prove useful, for instance, if later on, the recipients feel they need to buy a product from a catalog they got, or take advantage of a discount from a coupon sent through direct mail. In such a case, they’re much likelier to immediately consider going to the business that sent them the physical promotional material rather than one that sent them an email ad, for instance. While online advertisements are easier to be discarded, physical mail is usually there to stay, making it far more relatable and easier to go through over and over.

In essence, because of the fact that every recipient has to physically take a glance through all their mail received by post before discarding it, direct mail marketing gives marketers a huge advantage over their digital counterparts, as online ads are much easier to simply scroll past.

Materials sent in packages and envelopes, coupled with some clever marketing elements that are designed to incur sentiments of the times when sending mail by post was the norm, can also help recipients develop a more personal relationship with the businesses that sent them the direct mail. This, in turn, makes it more probable that the recipients will engage in an interaction with these businesses.

What’s more, direct mail helps marketers cover more ground by not limiting their outreach to internet users. This is especially true for those businesses whose target group includes a significant amount of people that don’t necessarily use the internet on a daily basis (or at all).

#### Controversies

Perhaps the most significant concern that the general public has when it comes to direct mail marketing is that when compared to online, TV, radio, and other forms of digital marketing, it’s the least environmentally-friendly option. Direct mailers often use a lot of paper, as well as other materials such as plastic, rope, and more. With the widely popular alternative of simply switching their marketing campaigns to the digital format, the usage of physical materials by direct mail marketers can be considered unnecessary or even wasteful by the recipients.

This can, in turn, have an impact on the brand image of these businesses as well, as [ethical consumption](https://developmenteducation.ie/feature/ethical-consumption/) is becoming ever more relevant nowadays. In fact, one of the main reasons businesses are increasingly moving their marketing to the digital (and especially online) sphere is precisely because they want to lower their environmental impact and the negative public image that comes with it. With this in mind, in some cases, recipients are allowed to opt out of getting direct mail from particular marketers.

Among many recipients, direct mail marketing campaigns also have a reputation for being a spammy or even intrusive method. Much like digital ads are often discarded as spam or junk mail, the same thing can happen with physical promotional materials. The difference is that direct mail takes a more significant amount of space and, as such, is more likely to receive negative feedback than its digital counterpart.

#### Summary

Direct mail, or advertising mail, is a type of marketing through which marketers send their advertising materials to their target audience through traditional postal services. While more and more businesses are completely switching to digital marketing as time passes by, many still stick with the more traditional practice of direct mail marketing, as it brings  several advantages.

The fact that marketing campaigns are increasingly going online means that there’s less competition in the direct mail marketing sphere, which in turn means that direct mail marketing materials have a bigger chance to be seen. This kind of marketing lets marketers be more creative to catch the eye of the direct mail recipients, and it also helps them reach audiences that don’t necessarily spend a lot of time online or exposed to any kind of digital marketing.

One of the major controversies of using direct mail is its environmental impact. Using materials such as paper and plastic to send promotional materials can be seen as wasteful, and is a major reason why more and more businesses tend to switch entirely to digital marketing as a more environmentally friendly option. With the concept of ethical consumption gaining more and more traction, using direct mail marketing can have a negative brand impact for businesses. What’s more, direct mail is often considered junk mail by its recipients. As it takes up much more physical space compared to digital advertising materials, recipients are more likely to develop a negative reaction to receiving direct mail.

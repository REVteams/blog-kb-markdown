## With the advent and popularization of the internet, its ever-increasing usage is often talked about in terms of the content we find online.

When it comes to content creation, and especially its dissemination on the web, the usage of content management systems is common practice.

#### Definition

A content management system, or CMS, is a computer program or software application used to manage, create, edit, and store digital and web content. The CMS software is made to facilitate these processes for users that might not have the programming skills necessary to build specific kinds of content from scratch and upload them on the web. 

#### What Are Content Management Systems Used For

Creating and managing web content is the most common use for CMS software. On the web, content comes in many forms — text, image, audio, video, and more. While writing a text or filming a video may be simple enough, creating a webpage to store this kind of content without a CMS would require coding. For users with little to no coding skills, CMSs are a great way to upload, access, and modify their content online, as well as to share it with the general public. CMSs even let their users create content directly in them, which is notably the case with textual content. 

While managing web content is what CMS solutions are most popular for, it’s not the only thing they can be used for, either. Other notable uses for CMS software include document management, [enterprise content management](https://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/definition/enterprise-content-management-ECM), [record retention](http://www.osp.emory.edu/handbook/-fin-award-admin/record-retention.html), and more.

#### Examples of CMS Software

Popular CMS solutions include platforms such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/), [TYPO3](https://typo3.com/), and so on. 

From all these, WordPress is by far the most popular, powering [around 40%](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/wordpress-powers-39-5-of-all-websites/391647/) of all websites that use a CMS. It’s important to keep in mind, however, that the WordPress CMS is stored on the WordPress.org site which is self-hosted — that is, it lets users host their page on their own server — and not on WordPress.com that is itself a host.

#### How CMS Software Simplifies Content Management

As WordPress is the most representative example of a well-known and extremely versatile CMS, its functions can be used as an example to demonstrate how CMS software works. 

As explained above, creating content and displaying it on a webpage would be more complicated without a CMS. To upload something as simple as text content on a website without a CMS, users would first have to use a programming language to write a file — often the simplest procedure includes a static HTML file — and upload it to their server, which can take some time and effort even for those that do have coding skills.

WordPress, on the other hand, completely simplifies this process. For textual content uploads, it features a system that looks similar to writing a blog post or a simple text document. It comes complete with a title box, text box, and formatting options such as font size, style, quick hyperlink, and other options you’d expect from a regular word processing software.

When it comes to uploading different kinds of media, the situation is very similar. While users who don’t use CMS software would have to directly interact with their web servers to upload and manage images, video, and audio content, WordPress simplifies the process by letting them upload media into its media library and display it on their websites if they choose so. 

WordPress also features a dashboard as part of its interface, which lets users directly manage several aspects of running their websites, such as setting up a homepage, managing site menus, and more. WordPress site creators can pick from various pre-made [themes](https://wordpress.org/themes/), acting as templates that let them customize the appearance of their websites. It also includes a wide variety of [plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/) that add extra features and functionalities to the websites of WordPress users.

Most of the above-mentioned features are also shared by other CMS solutions. CMS software doesn’t simply manage and upload content in the backend, either — it also allows for various levels of content customization, depending on the individual CMS solution in use.

It should be noted that, while CMS software makes content upload and management far easier, many users with coding knowledge will still opt to manually program their content files and upload them on their servers. This is because CMS software also limits users in many areas, especially when it comes to web development, that can otherwise be managed and modified through coding. 

#### CMS Components

In technical terms, every CMS software includes two essential components:

* **The content management application (CMA)** — this component is the part of the CMS directly related to content management. It lets users upload, edit, and manage their content when adding it to their site. 
* **The content delivery application (CDA)** — this component is the backend part of the CMS. It works in the background with the other component, the CMA. It’s essentially a process that registers the content users add to the CMA, stores it, and then enables it to be displayed on the website. 

#### Summary

A content management system (CMS) is a computer program for creating, editing, managing, and storing digital content. CMS software is commonly used for managing content on a website.

CMS makes it easier for people that don’t have coding experience to store and edit content online. Except for web content management, CMS software can also be used for document management, enterprise content management, record retention, and more.

The most popular CMS software is WordPress, accounting for around 40% of all CMS-based websites in use. Other CMS solutions include Squarespace, Joomla, Drupal, Wix, TYPO3, and many more.

CMS software solutions such as WordPress simplify web content management by removing the need for writing programming language files to upload and manage content. They provide users with content editors — from text content options similar to blogs and word editors to media libraries for other content such as images, audio, and video — thus removing the need for users to upload programming language files directly to their servers. CMSs also include dashboards for managing websites, as well as a variety of other functionalities such as pre-made themes, plugins, and more.

On a technical level, CMSs are made up of two key components: a content management application (CMA) that lets users upload and edit content, and a content delivery application (CDA) that works in the background to ensure that this content is properly stored and displayable on the users’ websites.

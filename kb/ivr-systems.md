# IVR Systems

## Companies working in different fields and industries often rely on their phone lines for communication — especially when contacting their clients and partners.

Throughout the past decades, as the market was becoming more and more dynamic, and as the practice of automation in business was developing, new technological advancements have led to the innovation of automatized phone call response mechanisms, created to ameliorate the job of phone agents employed by companies. These mechanisms are integrated into interactive voice response systems, or IVR systems for short.

#### Definition

In telecommunications terminology, interactive voice response (IVR) systems are a business phone technology that automates the process of interaction between humans and the organization they’re calling. When callers dial an organization’s phone number and get an automatic response in the form of a [pre-recorded voicemail](http://www.engagecrm.io/blog/features-prerecorded-voicemails) giving them several options on how they’d like their call to proceed, it means they’ve reached the organization’s IVR system. 

#### Background

IVR systems have been in development since the second half of the 20th century. Historically, IVR systems were difficult to put in motion. This fact, coupled with the expensiveness of the equipment and processes needed for IVR systems to work, meant that they were in limited use in business circles during the first years of their existence.

The requirements for the functioning of more traditional IVR systems included things such as IVR software installed on hardware separately from the [business communication platform](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/what-are-business-communication-platforms-and-how-do-they-work-explained/2028907/), a phone service for this software to work ([VoIP](https://www.nextiva.com/blog/what-is-voip.html) or [PSTN](https://www.nextiva.com/blog/what-is-pstn.html)), a database for accessing relevant [data](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-data), and separate infrastructure (servers) for the system. This means that IVR software used up a separate computer and its users had to have a [telephony card](https://www.voip-info.org/telephony-cards/) to make it work. What’s more, users needed specialized professionals to set up their IVR systems. 

This traditional IVR system setup is used less and less, mostly by some call centers that still use their old IVR technology. Nowadays, [cloud contact center](https://www.genesys.com/definitions/what-is-a-cloud-contact-center) providers are usually in charge of things like phone services, databases, and server infrastructure. These providers offer users integrated IVR systems, which work great with other features used in call centers such as automatic call distribution ([ACD](https://getvoip.com/library/automatic-call-distribution/)), for instance.

With cloud contact centers, users don’t have to install software separately, use on-premise infrastructure, or hire professionals specifically for managing their IVR systems. All this makes the expense of using cloud contact center IVR systems much lower than that of their traditional counterparts.

#### How IVR Systems Work

When someone calls a company’s phone number, the ACD answers it with its auto-attendant. Then, the company’s IVR system takes over by giving callers a menu with options they can choose from, such as language, payment options, contacting a live agent, and more, depending on the nature of the business using the IVR.

A majority of IVR systems work with [DTMF tones](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-dtmf), which means they function by having the caller press a button on their own telephone’s keyboard. More modern cloud contact center solutions also use [speech recognition](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/speech-recognition) to give callers voice responses through their integrated IVR systems, meaning that users can pick an option by speaking instead of using their phone keypads. 

Callers pick their choices from the options that the IVR menu provides them with, and the system acts based on these choices. In this way, the callers provide the IVR system with information related to the reason for their call, which helps their self-service process resolve their queries. If a caller’s needs are more complex and can’t be answered through the automatic response, the IVR system can qualify the severity of the issue and route the call to a human agent that’s skillful enough to take care of these needs. 

#### How Are IVR Systems Used

Businesses and their contact centers commonly use IVR systems as a tool for routing the calls they receive, which can sometimes come in high volumes and therefore require this kind of automation. For instance, a company can use an IVR system to find out if a client who’s calling them needs to be addressed to a specialized department such as technical support, payments, and so on. 

Apart from that, IVR systems can also use the automatic voice response to inform callers about things such as instructions related to the call itself, promotions that a business might be offering, and a variety of different kinds of information that the business deems relevant. For instance, the IVR system can inform a caller that their call is being recorded, and require them to press a button to confirm they agree to this. 

IVR systems slash company costs, as they can often eliminate the need for having to hire extra live agents for answering simple caller inquiries. Historically, IVR systems didn’t have this feature and were simply used for organizing the caller queues of call centers, but the latest developments in IVR technologies have enhanced the systems with a variety of other possibilities. For example, a business can use an IVR system to inform a caller about their account balance, change their password, receive minor payments, provide them with basic information concerning products or services it provides, and so on. 

#### Summary

Interactive voice response (IVR) systems are a business phone technology used to automate the process of interaction between humans and the organization they’re calling. Callers dialing the phone number of an organization using IVR systems get an automatic response in the form of a pre-recorded voicemail giving them several options on how they’d like their call to proceed.

In the past, IVR systems were more difficult to use, since they required IVR software installed on separate hardware, a phone service, a database, separate server infrastructure, as well as a dedicated professional hired to manage them. These traditional IVR systems are used less and less, mostly by call centers that have a hard time giving up on their old IVR technologies.

Nowadays, cloud contact centers provide integrated IVR systems to organizations. These cloud providers usually handle all components of IVR systems including phone services, databases, and server infrastructure. This makes cloud contact center IVR systems much cheaper to use than traditional ones.

An IVR system works by processing calls after they reach the auto-attendant of the automatic call distribution. From here, the IVR system gives the caller a menu with several options they can interact with and choose from, usually by pressing buttons on their own phone’s keyboard, and in some cases even by voice recognition. The caller’s choices inform the IVR system on how to automatically respond to their queries or — if what they ask for is more complex — to route the call to a human agent.

Businesses use IVR systems to route high call volumes and give callers relevant information automatically. IVR systems help businesses slash costs by answering simpler caller inquiries and eliminating the need of hiring more human agents for this task.

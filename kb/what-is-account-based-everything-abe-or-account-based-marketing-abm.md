# What is Account-Based Everything (ABE) or Account-Based Marketing (ABM)

## Account-based everything (ABE) is a strategy used by companies that deal with business-to-business (B2B) sales. It’s mainly employed as a way of finding the right target group to market to so that brands can avoid squandering their energy & resources

### Account-Based Everything Definition

Account-based everything (ABE) or account-based revenue is a B2B strategy that capitalizes on the simple idea that instead of making generic campaigns for a company’s products/services and creating mass marketing messages, the focus should be on tailoring the approach and targeting the right audiences — that is, the right **accounts**.

So, rather than casting their nets to all in the hopes of catching some, companies using ABE are developing personalized programs and messages aimed at the target accounts and tailored to address the specific needs and characteristics of the given account.

An example would be a brand trying to sell very expensive software. It would make zero sense for the brand to go after each and every small or even medium-sized company. The accounts that would be worthwhile to go after in this scenario would be those who need the software and those who can afford to buy the software. 

### The History of Account-Based Everything

Account-based strategies are not new. Companies were beginning to realize that the one-size-fits-all approach was in need of changes as far back as the 1990s. 

In 1993, [The One to One Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/724622.The_One_to_One_Future) was published and would later become a true bible for marketers worldwide. This ground-breaking book prompted a paradigm shift from mass marketing to, as the title itself suggests, one-to-one marketing, i.e. more personalized marketing. 

Account-based methods were being used as early as the 90s. Finally, in 2004, [ITSMA](https://www.itsma.com/account-based-marketing-hot-topic/), a company that provides advice and support services for B2B marketing companies, coined the term “account-based marketing”. However, it was only in the last couple of years that the concept truly picked up. 

Finally, it has recently been pointed out that account-based marketing is not enough on its own, as there is a need for much greater cross-sectional coordination in targeting key accounts — **every** department must work together, including marketing, sales, sales development, and customer success. Therefore, a new term was pioneered to highlight this organization-wide effort at a targeted set of accounts — **account-based everything**. The term was introduced by the Analyst team of [TOPO](https://topohq.com/), a renowned research and advice enterprise. 

### Tips to Implement Account-Based Everything

Understanding account-based everything is one thing, but how can companies implement this approach in their marketing? Let us quickly look into some important tips to properly implement this buzz concept.

#### Identifying High-Value Accounts

The first step is to identify a list of the right target accounts to go after. This involves going through a company’s customer base and analyzing who its ideal customers are. Of course, this varies depending on the company and industry. Questions that can help guide businesses in this process are the following: 

* Is this customer in need of our product/service? 
* If so, are they willing to spend an X amount of money on our product/service? 

### Data-Based Strategies

The account methods a company uses should be data-driven, not based on randomness. This means that a business should have almost all of the necessary information on the accounts that they have identified as most important. This data should then of course be shared among all sectors, allowing for cross-sectional coordination.

### Coordinating the Joint Efforts of Marketing, Sales, Sales Development, and Customer Support

Coordination across different departments of the company might be the most challenging aspect of ABE, but at the same time, it is the thing that determines whether an account-based strategy will ultimately be successful. 

Therefore, businesses should adopt a unified database across all departments. They should ensure that all of the relevant departments are aligned from the very moment they determine the aim of the campaign. 

For example, if the aim is to achieve a 20% increase in customer retention, the business would hold regular meetings with all these departments to evaluate what works well and what doesn’t. 

### Creating Personalized Interactions With Customers

ABE is all about adopting a personalized approach with the customer. Therefore, all the emails, phone calls, campaign content, ads, and other interactions that a company directs towards the account they are going after need to resonate with the needs and challenges of the specific account. The company should make it a point to even personalize their interactions with the different individuals within an account (like CEOs, sales managers, and others).  

The most important thing to remember here is that brands don’t need to focus so much on how valuable the product is in general, but rather, on how valuable it is to the given customer.

For example, a personalized campaign with customized video content will typically include the name and title of the executive or the account logo/name. These [guidelines](https://blog.topohq.com/12-sales-plays-account-based-everything/) by TOGO are useful for gaining further insight into creating personalized interactions.

### Maintaining the Relationship

With ABE, the company’s departments develop and maintain the relationships with the targeted account until they finally become a customer, and even beyond that point. The frequency of interactions will vary from one customer to the other, as there is no rule to follow here. 

#### Examples of a Personalized ABE Approach

[GumGum](https://gumgum.com/about), a global technology and media company, wanted to win over T-Mobile. To achieve this, they researched the account beforehand, starting with the executive team. GumGum learned that the CEO of T-Mobile, John Legere, was a Batman fan. After this was communicated with all the relevant departments, GumGum created a personalized comic book (T-Man and Gums), where John was part of the story. 

After months of hard work by a whole team of writers, editors, and illustrators, T-Man and Gums came out. Hundreds of copies were sent to T-Mobile, and needless to say, GumGum got themselves a new customer!

Now, to be fair, this is an example of investing a lot of resources in advance and not all businesses can afford to. But, a company could easily analyze the social media of the key individuals within an account and make a personalized direct email campaign nevertheless. 

Apart from adding a personalized touch, what is also especially important in ABE is organizing **cross-sectional cooperation**. 

A good example of such cross-sectoral cooperation would be the following: let’s imagine that a member of the customer services team overhears a dog barking while talking on the phone with a contact of the targeted account. At the regular cross-sectional meetings that the company has, the customer services member would typically share this information with the sales and marketing teams. They would then use it for personalization and send a dog bowl to the customer, for instance.

### Why Is Account-Based Everything Beneficial?

There is no doubt a lot of hype around ABE, but why should a business decide to adopt this approach in the first place? Some of the main benefits include:

* **Organization-wide cooperation** — Success starts with communication. In the example mentioned above, with the customer that owned a dog, we can easily observe the benefit of having good communication and cooperation across all sectors. 
* **Increased revenue** — The main point of adopting any strategy is to increase revenue. Companies in which the sales and marketing teams are aligned are said to have a [208% increase in revenue](https://www.marketo.com/account-based-marketing/). Talk about success!
* **A decrease in wasted resources** — Since the time and efforts of all relevant departments are focused on targeting fewer accounts that are more likely to be won over, resources that would have been wasted in a generic campaign become available instead, and can be put to better use.
* **Customers like it** — It has been shown time and time again that customers prefer a personalized touch. In fact, [75% of customers](https://www.getsmartacre.com/6-clear-benefits-account-based-marketing/) claimed they prefer personalized offers. And, at the end of the day, every brand’s aim is to please customers: they are proverbially always right, after all.

# What is a Lead?

## The most basic economic activity businesses engage in is selling products and/or services to buyers. Selling makes up the backbone of financial prosperity for businesses since it’s usually their most important — if not their only — source of income.

However, [buyers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) are not always easy to find, and to get to them, businesses have to engage in marketing activities more often than not. Here, the concept of leads serves as a basis for marketing campaigns.

#### Definition

In sales and marketing terminology, the term lead is used to refer to an entity — an individual or an organization — that may be interested in a product or service that a business is selling. For businesses, leads act as potential buyers that they can eventually [convert](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) into paying customers when (and if) they manage to [close a deal](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal) with them.

[Generating leads](https://rev.team/kb/lead-generation) is one of the most important marketing processes that businesses engage in. It usually serves as the basis for all other marketing and sales activities directed at potential as well as paying customers.

#### Leads and Sales

A business can find leads by engaging in various marketing activities, such as carrying out email campaigns, organizing trade shows, posting ads, third-party word of mouth, and more. After finding leads, businesses go through the process of carefully analyzing and qualifying them to establish how interested they are in their products and/or services, and how likely they are to convert to customers in the future.

To determine how qualified each lead is, salespersons analyze a number of categories related to them, such as:

* How motivated they were to give out their personal (and contact) info;
* Whether the information they gave the business was accurate (and to what extent);
* Whether the leads were aware of the businesses’ products and/or services when they gave feedback to the salesperson;
* And more.

After the leads have been generated and qualified, salespersons place them in their business’s [sales pipeline](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/sales-pipeline-fundamental-stages). This indicates the beginning of the sales process, and at this stage, salespersons go through the contact info their leads left them (usually emails, sometimes phone numbers, and so on) and make attempts at [pitching sales](https://revenuegrid.com/blog/7-sales-pitch/) by sending promotional emails, marketing materials, or simply calling their phone numbers.  

#### Finding Leads Online

In today’s day and age, the Internet has long been the daily habit of a huge number of people around the world, and this number increases by the day. Because of this, the Internet now covers almost all aspects of daily life, and especially business and marketing.

The widespread use of the Internet makes it the go-to method for salespersons looking for leads, as it’s made it easier to get through to wider audiences than ever before. With this in mind, finding leads online isn’t a simple task, but rather a strategic effort that only skillful salespersons and marketers are good at.

Businesses can gain insights into the needs of the members of their target audience, as well as the problems they face. They can then use these insights to offer different kinds of solutions to the needs and problems of their audience — from materials on how to use products or services, to webinars, informative podcasts, e-books, online sessions answering questions, and other forms of online assistance that can help raise their leads’ interest in their brands. 

In some cases, businesses can offer their leads a free product, service, or any other type of content they’d normally charge for with the aim of getting them to share their contact information (email, phone number, etc.), register on their website, or fill out a form. Common examples of such free materials given out to encourage leads to interact with a brand include free trial periods for services, sample products, white papers, exclusive tips, and more.

A significant obstacle that businesses face during this process is online privacy concerns. Namely, more and more users are growing increasingly reluctant to provide their personal information to businesses online, fearing information leaks, credentials misuse, or simply feeling unwilling to share their details with anyone over the web. 

### The Role of Social Media in Lead Generation

The increasing popularity of the many social media platforms has made them a primary choice for online marketing campaigns, including lead generation. The bulk of any social media marketing and lead generation effort usually consists of businesses working on engaging their leads by liking, sharing, and commenting on their social media posts and any other content they upload to these platforms. 

#### Finding Leads Offline

Internet and phone calls aren’t the only way to generate leads. More traditional methods of finding leads also work pretty well to this day. For instance, businesses often organize live events and seminars where they present their products or services to attendees, trying to raise their interest and sometimes even go for sales pitches. Similarly, they can also participate in [trade shows](https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/trade-show), where they present their brands along with other businesses from their industry.

Apart from that, businesses can also reach out to leads and potential customers through posting ads on physical spaces such as billboards, as well as on TV and the radio. Another very effective way to engage leads is by showing social responsibility, through supporting and donating to public, non-profit, and charity organizations.

#### Summary

In sales and marketing, a lead is an individual or an organization that may show interest in a product or service that a business is selling. A business’s leads are the potential buyers that it hopes to convert into paying customers further down the line.

A business can find leads by engaging in various marketing activities, both online and offline. After generating leads, businesses carefully analyze and qualify them to establish how interested they are in their products and/or services, and how likely they are to convert to customers in the future. To do so, they try to measure how motivated their leads were to give out their contact information, to what extent this information is accurate, and whether they were aware of the businesses’ products and/or services when they gave feedback to the salesperson.

From there on, salespersons place leads in their business’s sales pipeline, starting the sales process. Here, salespersons go through the contact info of their leads to try and pitch a sale by sending them promotional emails, marketing materials, or calling their phone numbers. 

Nowadays, businesses mostly hunt for leads online, due to the ever more widespread usage of the Internet and the access they get to wide audiences through it. Through the Internet, businesses can gain insights into the needs and problems of the members of their target audience, and then come up with solutions to offer them. In some cases, businesses can offer their leads free materials in order to engage them. 

There are also alternative ways to get leads without using the internet. These include organizing and participating in live events, posting ads on physical locations and traditional media, engaging audiences through socially responsible behavior, and more.

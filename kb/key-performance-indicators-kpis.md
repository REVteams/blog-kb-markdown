# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

## When measuring their overall success, businesses sometimes compare their results against hard numbers — often quantifiable achievements of other businesses working in the same industry — that are considered as standards of success in their field.

Recently established businesses focus on achieving these numbers, whereas more experienced ones aim to surpass them.

Regardless of the sector they operate in or their experience, businesses of all kinds consider it necessary to monitor their success over time. In practice, one of the most effective ways to achieve this is by using key performance indicators, or KPIs for short. 

#### Definition

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are quantifiable measurements used by businesses to evaluate their performance. By analyzing the results of KPI usage, businesses can determine whether they (or their individual employees) have succeeded at achieving their predetermined goals or reached a certain level of performance they had previously set out to achieve.

#### The Importance Of KPIs

In business practice, KPIs are considered to be the most relevant metrics that help businesses focus on their targets by evaluating their success. Every department within a business may use a different KPI based on the type of the business, its strategy, or the sector it operates in. 

Businesses need KPIs to quantify their success, to set their strategies, and to reach — or at least approach — their financial and operational goals. As a business strives to increase its performance and optimize workloads, it can compare its current business strategies to its KPI measurements to determine whether these strategies are worth keeping or should be abandoned in favor of different ones. 

Here, it’s important to note that KPIs only measure [quantifiable values](https://www.remarq.io/articles/quantifiable-and-intangible-value/) — in other words, values that can be measured and displayed in numbers. For instance, the morale of a company’s workforce can be an important factor for its performance, but it can’t be shown as a number or a percentage and is therefore not a KPI.

#### Commonly Used KPIs

There are many different kinds of KPIs available for businesses to use. They’re commonly divided into subgroups of financial, customer-related, and process performance indicators.

The exact KPIs chosen by each business will depend on the business itself, its goals, the industry it’s part of, and other factors. Some of the most commonly used KPIs include revenue growth rate, revenue per client, profit margin, client retention rate, customer satisfaction, and more.

### Revenue Growth Rate

This KPI measures sales increases or decreases over time and is shown as a percentage. It’s calculated by first determining two equal periods (weeks, months, years), subtracting the first period’s revenue from that of the second period, dividing the result by the first period’s revenue, and then multiplying by 100 to obtain a percentage. So, the formula for calculating revenue growth rate is the following:

**(Revenue from period 2 — Revenue from period 1) / Revenue from period 1 X 100 = (%)**

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a company is calculating its monthly revenue growth rate. This company has made **\$10,000** in revenue during the first month, and **$40,000** during the second month it’s measuring. To calculate its revenue growth rate from the first to the second month, it needs to use the following equation:

**(\$40,000 — \$10,000) / \$10,000 x 100 = \$30,000 / $10,000 x 100 = 3 x 100 = 300%**

From this, we can conclude that moving from the first to the second month, the company’s revenue has grown **300%.**

### Revenue per Client

This KPI measures the average dollar amount of revenue generated by each [client](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) of the business. Alternatively, this KPI can also go by the name of revenue per user, or average revenue per user. 

### Profit Margin

Businesses often use profit margins to calculate how much profit they make on each dollar gained through sales operations. Profit margin is calculated by looking at the difference between a business’s costs and its revenue.

Profit margin is commonly shown as either [gross profit margin](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-gross-margin) or net profit margin. The difference between the two is that gross profit margin only substracts [COGS](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-cost-of-goods-sold-cogs) from a business’s net revenue, whereas net profit margin subtracts all of a business’s expenses from this revenue (including COGS).

### Client Retention Rate

This KPI is used to measure the ability of a business to retain customers over the long term, as well as to generate recurring revenue from existing customers.

### Customer Satisfaction

This KPI measures values used to track and determine how well [customer service](https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-cloud/what-is-customer-service/) teams are performing.

#### How do KPIs work?

Businesses commonly use different types of KPIs for different departments. For example, sales KPIs should track the values that will help salespersons [close more deals](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal). Marketing leaders, in turn, need to track KPIs which help them measure their progress against clearly defined marketing goals. Manager KPIs, on the other hand, reflect the business’s strategic priorities.  

A business will pick its relevant KPIs according to what it wants to achieve by measuring them. To achieve the best results, the business must make sure everyone on its team understands why particular KPIs are measured and knows how to process each specific KPIs, focusing on the most impactful of these measurements in order to apply the results in practice. 

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a business that wants to strengthen its customer base must first set a target. It should determine what it wants to achieve by measuring customer-related KPIs. 

For instance, if the business’s target is gaining 1000 new customers, it should start by determining the time it has to achieve that goal. If the timeframe for the accomplishment of the target is by the end of the year, the business should set the frequency monthly. If it doesn’t have 500 new customers by the middle of the year, it probably won't reach 1000 by the end of it, meaning it likely needs to change its customer acquisition strategy. 

Apart from the number of new contracts signed per period, the business should also consider other indicators such as the dollar value for new contracts, the number of resources spent on sales, and net sales. Customer-related KPIs should help the business quantify its growth in revenue, net profit margin, current [accounts receivables](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/accounts-receivable/), [inventory turnover](https://www.tradegecko.com/inventory-management/inventory-turnover-formula), and so on. 

Good KPIs should provide accurate information. They’re meant to track the quality, timeliness, and performance of a business over time. A business knows it has chosen the right KPIs if it uses metrics that are essential to achieving its vision of success with its combination of leading indicators, if the results are clear enough, and if it can successfully track these results over predetermined time periods. 

#### Summary

Key performance indicators (KPIs) represent quantifiable values that businesses use to measure their performance. Through KPIs, businesses can see whether they are successful at achieving their predetermined goals or reaching performance levels.

KPIs are often considered as the important metrics for helping businesses evaluate their success. Within a business, each department may use a different KPI adapted to its own needs. By using KPIs, businesses evaluate their success, determine their strategies, and strive to reach their pre-set goals.

KPIs only measure quantifiable values that can be measured and displayed in numbers. Intangible values that can’t be quantified as numbers or percentages don’t qualify as KPIs.

Businesses use different kinds of KPIs commonly divided into subgroups of financial, customer-related, and process performance indicators. Some of the most commonly used KPIs include revenue growth rate, revenue per client, profit margin, client retention rate, customer satisfaction, and more.

Different business departments use different KPIs. Sales KPIs help salespersons close more deals, marketing KPIs allow marketers to compare their success against pre-set marketing goals, manager’s KPIs reflect the business’s strategic priorities, and so on.

Good KPIs provide accurate information and can track the business’s quality, timeliness, and performance over particular time periods. They should provide the business with metrics that are essential to achieving its vision of success, the results of their measurements should be clear enough, and the business should be able to track these results periodically.

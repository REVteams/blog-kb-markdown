# What is Horizontal?

## Successful companies often aim to expand their businesses in various ways.

This is often seen as a necessary step that such companies need to make if they want to continue growing, increase their presence on their market, and improve their capacities for generating revenue. One way in which companies can expand is through horizontal integration.

#### Definition

In marketing and business terminology, the term horizontal refers to a kind of integration or acquisition by a company for the sake of its growth. Horizontal integrations happen when companies take over businesses related to their own (coming from the same industries) or, in some cases, create such businesses themselves.

#### Why Companies Practice Horizontal Integration

The main goal of horizontal acquisition or integration is overall company growth. Some of the objectives leading up to this goal — and achievable by practicing horizontal integrations by a company — include:

* Company enlargement size-wise;
* Increasing production;
* Saving on money and resources through [economies of scale](https://www.thebalance.com/economies-of-scale-3305926);
* Gaining an edge over competitors;
* Getting more traction among third-party suppliers and distributors;
* Distinguishing the products or services a company produces among those of their competitors;
* Increasing a company’s presence on the marketplace where it sells;
* Reaching new marketplaces;
* And more.

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a retail company such as a supermarket is trying to obtain a higher share of the marketplace where it sells its products. To do so, it decides to buy off another, smaller supermarket brand in order to expand its selling capacity to the customers of said smaller supermarket.

Ultimately, as a result of this horizontal acquisition of a similar business, the supermarket aims to become more profitable and grow its business. The supermarket will also slash some of its costs through the acquisition because both businesses — now merged into a single one — will share their technologies, innovation efforts, marketing endeavors, production capacities, distribution logistics, and so on.

With this in mind, it’s important to note that the more similar both businesses are, the easier it will be to successfully horizontally integrate one of these into the other. Different business practices and cultures may prove to be a difficulty during an attempted horizontal integration, and differences that are too big to overcome may result in a failure for the merging effort.

#### Why Is Horizontal Integration Important

There are several reasons why a company would decide to use horizontal acquisitions throughout its lifetime. One of the main reasons, as stated above, is the fact that horizontal integration can give a company a larger share of the market where it sells its products and/or services.

Horizontal acquisition helps a company take over the production, technological, marketing, and service-providing capacities of the business it integrates. This, in turn, leads to lowering the costs related to production as well as increased output, which also increases the company’s reach to a wider [client](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) base.

Greater market presence and an increased number of [customers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) translates into increased profitability for companies at the receiving end of horizontal integration. What’s more, by horizontal integration, companies assimilate similar businesses which are also (potential) competitors for the same marketplace, leaving more room for the integrating companies to sell their products and/or services.

#### Downsides

While the benefits of horizontal acquisitions for a company’s business are many, there are also some repercussions towards such moves coming from the wider market, especially when a process of integration of another business is successfully carried out. Since horizontal integration effectively means that one company assimilates another into its capacities, as a practice, it’s sometimes scrutinized by the wider public, including by governmental agencies.

The main type of criticism directed towards horizontal integration stems precisely from the fact that company mergers reduce the competition within a particular marketplace. This means that customers have fewer choices to pick from when they want to buy products or services in that particular field.

While seemingly harmless, multiplication of this type of practice can result in [monopolies](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/monopoly); in other words, situations where a single company is either the dominant or, in some cases, the sole presence within a particular market. In many cases, monopolist companies can afford to increase prices of products and/or services they provide, as well as control their supply and even decide on how available they are as they see fit. As horizontal acquisitions hint at a company moving towards assuming a monopolist position, they’re seen as a bad thing in many situations.

It is precisely because of uncontrolled horizontal acquisitions that [antitrust laws](https://www.uschamber.com/antitrust-laws) exist. These laws are supposed to stop predatory practices of acquisitions susceptible to leading towards the creation of a monopoly by any single company.

Apart from this, horizontal acquisitions can also make the newly created company less flexible as a result of the merger. This is because companies that are smaller in scale also have more maneuvering space when doing business, as many of their operations are generally easier to pull off because of the smaller numbers of their workforce.

After a horizontal integration has taken place, however, the result is a company with a larger, more expansive internal structure. The very fact that companies have more employees after horizontal integration means they become more bureaucratic, have more processes to keep in mind, and need to be more transparent in their dealings as a result.

The risk of a horizontal integration failing is not to be taken lightly, either. This risk is especially present when the two sides of a horizontal integration don’t share the same business culture. A horizontal integration that backfires will render both companies less valuable as a result, which is the opposite of what the process is supposed to achieve.

#### Summary

Horizontal integrations or acquisitions are practiced by successful companies that want to grow. Through horizontal integration, companies take over businesses similar to their own, and in some cases create such businesses themselves.

Some of the objectives of horizontal integration include company enlargement, production increase, economies of scale, gaining an advantage over competitors, getting more influence over distributors, increasing product or service differentiation, increasing market presence, entering new markets, and more.

Horizontal integration is important because it can give a company a larger share of the market where it sells its products and/or services. By taking over the production, technological, marketing, and service-providing capacities of the business it integrates, a company lowers its production costs and increases its output, which also helps it reach more clients.

Because of the fact that horizontal integration helps companies increase their market presence and reach a wider client base, they end up turning in more profits than before. Apart from that, by integrating businesses from the same industry, companies eliminate potential competition from the marketplace they sell to, giving them more room to promote their own products or services there.

Besides its many benefits, however, horizontal integration also has several downsides. The major criticism this practice receives from the general public, and most notably governmental organizations, stresses the fact that integrating businesses leaves less competition in a marketplace. This means that customers have fewer options to choose from when buying products or services. This practice can eventually lead to monopolies, where a single business controls a large part of a marketplace and is the main target of antitrust laws.

Horizontal acquisitions also carry the downside of lesser flexibility for the newly merged entity, stemming from its increased workforce and bureaucratization. Horizontal integrations can also fail if both sides don’t share a similar business culture.

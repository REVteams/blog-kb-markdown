# What is Doing Business As (DBA)? 

## Throughout their lifetime, the majority of businesses work diligently to build up a name for themselves and develop a recognizable brand — an essential step towards driving sales and increasing profitability.

However, in some cases, businesses can also benefit from being able to sell under a different name or brand than the one they’ve legally registered for themselves. In such cases, they can use a “doing business as” (DBA) name.

#### Definition

Doing business as, or DBA, is a name businesses can use which is different from the one they’re legally registered with. The DBA isn’t a legal category and therefore doesn’t ensure personal asset rights to the business using it — it does, however, allow said business to open a bank account and accept checks on this name.

#### Background

The DBA is a US version of a business pseudonym (or fictitious business name). In other countries, this pseudonym is known as a trading name or business name. In Canada, the term operating as (or O/A) is used in this case.

In the US itself, alternative terms for DBA are in use in different states, such as:

* **Trade name** — used by a very small number of states, notably Washington;
* **Fictitious name** — this term is used by a considerable number of states, such as Pennsylvania, Florida, and many more;
* **Assumed business name** or **assumed name** — one of these two terms is in use in almost half the states, such as New York, Oregon, and many more.

All of these terms refer to the same thing as the DBA, which is an alternative name businesses use to operate and sell. However, while the general concept behind all these terms remains the same, both within the USA and internationally, the details regarding actual legislation around DBA and its counterparts differ from state to state.

#### How Are DBAs Used

A DBA isn’t a legal category, unlike formal business structures such as [limited liability companies](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/limited-liability-company-llc) (LLCs), for example. Formal business structures, unlike DBA, provide a number of legal protections such as personal asset protection, limited liability protection, and others depending on the structure.

In essence, businesses such as LLCs that want to sell and advertise some of their products or services under a different name than the one they’re legally using, without having to create another legal entity altogether, are the usual candidates likely to use DBA names. Creating additional legal entities costs more money and requires extra effort, which businesses can skip by going for a DBA while still enjoying a certain degree of privileges such as:

* Receiving checks under the DBA name;
* Opening a separate business checking and other bank accounts for the DBA name;
* Applying for an [EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/employer-id-numbers) / federal tax ID number;
* And more.

Some of the most common DBA users are [sole proprietors](https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/sole-proprietorship). While a sole proprietorship isn’t a legal entity either, sole proprietors need to use a DBA (as an alternative to creating a separate LLC) if they wish to operate under any other name that doesn’t include their name, surname, and a description of their product or service.

Companies usually file for DBAs for reasons of a financial nature, to appear transparent in front of authorities, and to protect the [customers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) buying their products and/or services.

The easiest way to get a unique business name is to apply for a DBA from the government. Businesses that register their DBA have their info verified for their customers. In case the customers have any complaints regarding a business that uses a DBA, they can file these directly to the state in which the business has registered a DBA (or any of the other state-specific terms indicating a business pseudonym).

It’s important to note that by using a DBA, the business shares the legal liability for the products and services it sells under its new DBA brand. To separate the liabilities, they’d have to form a separate LLC.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

As a business, going for a DBA has several advantages. For one thing, when compared to opening a separate LLC for the purpose of using an alternative business name and brand, a DBA name is far easier to get and costs less money. DBA also protects the privacy of businesses applying for it because it doesn’t require personal names and other personal information for the application. It’s also a useful tool for marketing since it creates a unique brand for the business that can help it reach wider audiences and end-users.

There are also some shortcomings for businesses using DBA names, though. Most notably, they aren’t eligible to receive benefits such as property protection, limited liability protection, tax breaks, and other protections. In essence, since it’s not a legal category, the business doesn’t have a guarantee for the exclusive rights to the DBA name it chooses to promote itself through.

#### Examples

To illustrate DBA usage with an example, let’s say that an individual named Martha Sands wants to open a sole proprietorship business selling sweets. In case Martha wants to name this business anything else that isn’t ‘Martha Sands Sweets’, the options would be to either apply for a DBA for using another name or open a separate LLC.

In another example, let’s say that an LLC company selling bikes is called ‘Awesome Bikes LLC’ and that it wishes to expand to selling skateboards as well. Instead of opening another LLC to rebrand itself, this company can simply apply for the DBA name ‘Awesome Skateboards’.

#### Summary

Doing business as (DBA) is a pseudonym, or alternative name, that businesses use to operate under. A DBA name, unlike the business’s registered name, is not a legal category.

Businesses use DBA names when they want to sell products or services under a different name (or brand) than the one they’re already using, without having to go through the effort and incur the costs of creating a separate legal entity for that purpose.

Sole proprietorship businesses are common DBA users. This is because if sole proprietors want to give their business any name that doesn’t consist of the combination of their personal name, surname, and the description of the products or services they’re selling, they have to either use a DBA or start an LLC. On the other hand, LLCs can also use DBAs when they wish to start a new business venture.

DBAs are a cheaper and easier alternative to creating additional LLCs, while at the same time protecting the privacy of business owners and providing them with a strong marketing tool. On the other hand, unlike LLCs, DBAs don’t give their users privileges such as property protection, limited liability protection, tax breaks, and more.

As a rule, they file these reports each quarter — that is, a three-month period that makes up one quarter of their financial year. In this context, the term EOQ is used as an abbreviation for end-of-quarter.

#### Definition

End-of-quarter (EOQ) is a term that refers to the end of a company’s fiscal quarter, by the end of which it has to file a quarterly report — a collection of their unaudited financial statements including balance sheets, cash flow statements, income statements, and more — commonly as a legal obligation. EOQ dates are important for a company’s finance, sales, and accounting departments, as well as for potential investors and business analysts who evaluate the quarterly reports of companies.

EOQ is a common type of deadline for companies, regularly recurring at specific time intervals. In this sense, it is similar to other periodic deadlines such as end-of-month (EOM) and end-of-year (EOY).

#### Background

Each calendar year has four quarters. The abbreviations Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are commonly used in business terminology to refer to each separate quarter. As a general rule, each quarter is made up of the following months:

* **Q1** — January, February, and March;
* **Q2** — April, May, and June;
* **Q3** — July, August, and September;
* **Q4** — October, November, and December.

This means that the EOQ for Q1 is January 31st, for Q2 — June 30th, for Q3 — September 30th, and for Q4 — December 31sr, respectively.

#### EOQ in Accounting

The EOQ is an important date for accountants. Much like the monthly (EOM) and yearly (EOY) deadlines, accountants have to file reports for the quarterly EOQ date as well. As a common practice, companies also pay stock dividends on the EOQ date, as well.

With that in mind, the fiscal year accounting period for each individual company doesn’t always follow the same rules as the calendar year and may start at a different date. This means that the fiscal quarters for such companies will also be different from the general rule.

In many cases, companies set the end of their fourth fiscal quarter — and with it, the end of their fiscal year altogether — to coincide with the end of their busiest season of the year. For instance, companies that do most of their work (and get most of their income) during the summer season in June, July, and August, will commonly have their Q4 made up of these 3 months. Their fiscal year’s EOY (as well as their EOQ for Q4) will thus be set for August 31st, whereas the beginning of their next fiscal year (and their Q1 for it) will be on September 1st, accordingly.

In the United States, regulations set by the [Securities Exchange Committee (SEC)](https://www.sec.gov/) require companies whose equities are publicly traded to report on their performance at the EOQ of each of their four fiscal quarters. According to these SEC regulations, for the first 3 quarters, these companies file quarterly reports known as **10-Q**, which are generally unaudited reports containing information relevant to company finances (financial statements, operation-related information, and more). For the final quarter (Q4), these companies have to report to the SEC by filing an annual report which will include the information related to the fourth quarter as well. These annual reports are known as **10-K** and are much more elaborate than the 10-Q quarterly reports, including additional information related to areas such as company history, shareholder earnings, salaries for company executives, organizational structure, subsidiaries, and more.

### The Significance of EOQ Reports for Business Analysts and Investors

As quarterly reports demonstrate the financial state and performance of companies for each quarter, they’re also important to third parties such as business analysts and investors. This is because quarterly reports provide a much more detailed insight into the periodic performance of companies than their yearly counterparts, and are much easier to follow than monthly reports as they are rarer.

For instance, for an investor that is particularly looking for companies that perform well all year round, quarterly reports are crucial. A company’s yearly report may show an overall positive performance, but if its quarterly reports are analyzed, they can show, for example, that it only performs well during one particular season (that is, quarter) while having smaller numbers during the other three. With the information obtained by quarterly reports, the investor looking for all-year-round good performers to invest in will likely avoid such a company.

#### EOQ in Sales

The EOQ deadline is also significant to those sales professionals that have to fulfill quarterly sales quotas — that is, reach a predetermined number of sales by EOQ. This isn’t always the case, though, as many companies often prefer setting quotas on a monthly instead of a quarterly basis, which can be beneficial for several reasons.

Oftentimes, a salesperson’s [commission](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-commission) will depend on whether they reach their periodic quotas (and to what extent). This means that a salesperson’s quarterly bonus can depend on their sales performance measured at each EOQ deadline.

As quarterly bonuses are overall bigger than their monthly counterparts, this means that during the last months of a quarter, sales professionals working on quarterly quotas work under increased pressure to reach their targets.

Namely, a major reason why companies go for monthly quotas more often than quarterly quotas is that getting a monthly bonus helps motivate sales employees much more as they get their commissions more often (once a month as opposed to once every three months). However, there do exist companies that pay their sales professionals quarterly quotas as well, and for them, EOQ is a date they have to pay particular attention to every three months.

#### Summary

In business terminology, the term end-of-quarter (EOQ) refers to the ending date of a company’s fiscal quarter — a three-month period making up a quarter of their financial year. By their EOQ deadlines, companies must file their quarterly reports, which represent collections of their unaudited financial statements.

As a general rule, the calendar year is divided into four quarters. These include Q1 (January, February, and March), Q2 (April, May, and June), Q3 (July, August, and September), and Q4 (October, November, and December). According to this general rule, the EOQs for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 are January 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31sr, respectively.

The EOQ date is particularly important for accountants that have to file quarterly reports and is often also the date when companies pay stock dividends. Because each company’s fiscal year doesn’t necessarily coincide with the calendar year, the fiscal quarter and its EOQ can also be structured differently than the general rule applying to the calendar year.

In the United States, the Securities Exchange Committee (SEC) regulations oblige publicly traded companies to file quarterly fiscal reports. These regulations stipulate that public companies should file a quarterly report known as 10-Q for the first three quarters, and include their reports for their fourth quarters in the yearly report known as 10-K.

Business analysts and investors are particularly interested in quarterly reports, as well. This is because quarterly reports provide more detail into the seasonal financial performance of companies.

EOQ deadlines are also relevant for sales professionals that receive commissions based on fulfilling quarterly quotas. While most companies prefer paying commissions for monthly quotas for several reasons, some do practice quarterly quotas as well.

When looking to attract [buyers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) for their products and services, businesses often tend to focus on generating leads a lot. They can sometimes make the mistake of forgetting about the follow-up — that is, believing that all they need to do is to generate leads and then they will somehow naturally [convert](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) these into customers, which rarely ever happens without additional effort.

A generated lead is just a potential customer. To actually convert them into paying customers, the process between generating the lead and actually [closing a deal](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal) with them is crucial. It's unrealistic to expect that every lead will eventually convert to a customer, and the practice of lead nurturing significantly increases the chance of a conversion.

#### Definition

Lead nurturing is a process through which businesses engage and build long-term relationships with prospective customers. This process includes using many different marketing strategies that will develop their preferences to fit with a business’s products and/or services.

#### Background

According to Invesp, [around 80%](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/lead-nurturing/) of newly acquired leads don’t result in a purchase. While there are many ways to generate leads, just because a prospect was willing to give a business their contact information doesn’t mean that they are ready to buy a product or service from it. However, it does mean that the prospect is willing to open up to a channel where they will get more information about what the business can offer them.

With all this in mind, it would be unwise for businesses to overflood their leads with messages pressuring them to make a purchase. Instead, businesses should be aware of where each member of their target audience is situated in the [sales funnel](https://keap.com/product/sales-funnel) and give them product or service offers and information accordingly. 

Through lead nurturing, prospective customers are able to better understand what the business stands for, what value they can get from it, and how exactly its products and/or services are different from those of its competitors. This process builds their trust step by step until they are ready to complete a purchase.

#### Why Is Lead Nurturing Important?

A business can't usually go from a generated lead to customer conversion without additional efforts. It needs to invest time and build a relationship with its leads, gain their trust, and only then will it be able to close a sale.

Almost every lead is aware that other businesses also offer similar products and services, and they’re usually most eager to purchase from the ones that will give them the most value for their money. That's why each business needs to go through a few extra steps to convince its leads that its solutions are superior to those of its competitors. With the proper strategy, businesses can make sure that the time and energy they spend on nurturing their leads will be worth the [return on investment](https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/r/return-investment-roi) they get from it.

#### How to Create a Successful Lead Nurturing Campaign

To create solid lead nurturing campaigns, businesses can use several different tools, including segmenting their audience, providing it with value, and automatizing their email marketing, before they can finally focus on closing deals with their prospective customers.

#### Audience Segmentation

Not all leads are in the same spot in the buying process. Sending [calls to action](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/call-to-action/) (CTAs) to leads that are at the beginning of this process will make them feel pressured, and they might eventually lose interest in purchasing.

Businesses should, therefore, segment their leads according to their position in the buying process. This can be achieved by creating triggers based on opt-ins, lead scoring, and sending out surveys.

Businesses should also pay attention to analytics showing them the level of interaction of leads with their content. For instance, a business should be interested in knowing whether its leads are liking its posts on social media, downloading its free content, attending its webinars, etc. These insights will help it get a clearer image of the position of each one of its leads in the buying process.

Businesses should create their lead nurturing campaigns with special attention to guiding their leads through the buying process step by step, and then segment all their leads according to the steps of their campaigns.

#### Providing Value

Lead nurturing is a give-and-take strategy. Businesses cannot expect their prospective customers to give them their contact information, their time, and eventually their money as well, without getting anything in return.

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a prospective customer signs up to receive more information about a business. In this case, the business has to have an idea of what type of feedback will be most valuable to this particular prospect. It’s a safe bet to assume that this prospect won’t be expecting an email asking them to complete a purchase, but they might actually value receiving an e-book, a free webinar, a document that better presents the business and the value the products or services can bring them, for example.

#### Email Marketing Automatization

When automatizing their email marketing process, businesses should be careful not to put unrelated content in their emails. A good strategy would be coming up with the proper schedule for sending out promotional emails, but avoiding over-cluttering leads with constant messages.

To do so, businesses should try to think like their leads — what exactly would they like to receive from a business that would make them buy its product or service? Good automated emails should include things such as answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ) and some of the business's content (blog posts, videos, etc). Apart from this, these emails are also supposed to guide a business’s leads through the buying process, so they should also contain some sort of call to action (CTA). The CTA should be subtle at first, but it should still manage to deliver the right message to prospective buyers.

A big part of a successful email marketing campaign is the schedule in which messages are sent. If businesses spam their leads with constant emails, the leads will likely stop interacting with the content and simply move on. In the opposite case, if businesses rarely ever send emails to their leads, they might lose their interest. What a solid email schedule would be is different from business to business, but it usually includes sending an email every 2-3 days and skipping weekends, so that businesses can always have their leads' attention while at the same time not overwhelming them with content and calls to action.

#### Closing the Sale

When generating leads, the main focus of each business is the opportunity to close sales. While not every generated lead will eventually become a customer, without a good lead nurturing strategy, almost none will. 

Once a business sets up its lead nurturing campaign, and after putting the email marketing automatization in place, its marketing team will have its job made much easier. Marketers won't need to nurture every lead one by one, since the whole process is in place and mostly automatized. The only thing they’ll need to do from there on is to check the automated emails from time to time in order to replace old content (webinars, e-books) with new, updated materials. 

From here on, it’s up to the sales team to determine which leads can be considered the most qualified to make a purchase and focus on working with them to start closing sales.

#### Summary

The term lead nurturing is used to describe a process through which businesses build long-term relationships with their target audience. The idea behind this process is to educate prospective customers about the benefits that a business’s products and/or services can offer them.

While lead generation is something businesses often focus on, generated leads won’t always result in sales. Because of this, businesses need to engage in nurturing each lead and increase their chances of closing deals. When done right, lead nurturing will successfully lead to customer conversion, and thus provide businesses with a solid return on investment to make up for their time and efforts.

To create successful lead nurturing campaigns, businesses can use multiple tools. If a business correctly segments its audience, engages its leads with valuable content that will guide them through the buying process, provides them something in return for their contact information, answers their FAQ, and offers them quality content through automatized emails, it boosts the chances of closing sales with a high percentage of leads.

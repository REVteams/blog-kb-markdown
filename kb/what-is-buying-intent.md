# What is Buying Intent

## Businesses need to sell their products and services to generate revenue and survive on the market, so naturally, they need buyers. Traditionally, marketing and advertising have been used for the sole purpose of getting people to buy from businesses.

However, not everyone targeted by an advertising campaign is always a potential buyer — even those who actually interact and give feedback to such campaigns will not always end up buying a product or service from the businesses in question. Because of this, to better understand what part of their target audience can be converted into a customer base, businesses have come up with the concept of buying intent.

### Definition

The term buying intent, or purchase intent, is used to describe how likely it is that a particular individual or organization purchases a product or service offered by a business. This likelihood can be measured from behavior such as online browsing, media consumption, document downloads, event participation, and more.

### Evaluating Intent

For companies to be able to predict and measure buying intent, their marketing teams use a technique called [predictive modeling](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/predictive-modeling). With this technique, they can assess how probable it is for particular potential buyers to develop an interest in some of the company’s products or services.

Predictive modeling bases its predictions on multiple factors, such as site activity, purchase history, advertisement feedback, demographics, and more. To evaluate buying intent, marketers gather data from all of these categories, while trying to determine the potential influence on the increase or decrease of buying intent. They use the information they gain through this approach to enhance their marketing strategy.

### Why Is Buying Intent Important?

Analyzing all the different strains of customer-related data to determine the likelihood of committing to purchases can be a challenging task. However, if companies manage to properly evaluate the buying intent of individuals and organizations they aim to retain as buyers, it can bring them many advantages, including:

* Insights on how to better personalize marketing strategies;
* Higher conversion rates;
* More sales and increased revenue;
* Improved cooperation between the marketing and sales teams;
* And more.

### Intent Marketing

Due to the importance of evaluating buying intent, marketing teams have adapted their strategies around it, creating the concept of intent marketing — a strategy that analyzes the buying intent of each specific target audience before advertising a company’s products or services to them.

This approach appears similar to [personalization](https://instapage.com/blog/personalized-marketing) at first, but there are significant differences. Personalized marketing focuses on adapting advertising to the personal needs and demands of a single target individual or organization. Intent marketing, on the other hand, analyzes how much each segment of a company’s target audience is likely to be interested in their products or services before promoting them.

This specific kind of marketing is meant to save marketing teams the costs and effort of advertising and informing, assuming they’ll already be targeting an audience that is more or less intent on buying particular products or services.

### Buying Intent and the Marketing Funnel

The concept of buying intent is connected to that of the [marketing funnel](https://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-a-marketing-funnel). Potential buyers can display different levels of buying intent at every stage of the marketing funnel, or simply display informational intent — that is, wanting to know more about a company’s products or services — that can later lead them to develop buying intent further down the funnel line.

When particular individuals or organizations are simply browsing a company’s website, for example, they are showing informational intent. When they get to the point of looking at product prices, however, it means that a buying intent is well underway.

Here’s how potential buyers can show their buying intent — or the informational intent leading up to it — throughout the various stages of the marketing funnel:

* **Awareness** — At this stage, potential buyers are aware of the company’s products or services as something they may possibly need. The intent potential buyers show at this stage is informational because they’re trying to inform themselves about the solutions the company can offer them should they decide to contact it.
* **Consideration** — This stage implies that potential buyers have gone from being aware of a company’s products and services, to already considering them as something they could buy. The intent here is still on the informational level, but the information potential buyers seek is already becoming more streamlined towards particular products or services.
* **Decision** — At this point, potential buyers are already displaying behaviors that indicate they’re interested in actually making a purchase. This is the moment when informational intent turns into buying intent. Some clear indicators that a potential buyer has reached the decision stage include behaviors such as asking about how a product works, whether they can try it out, discussing potential purchase conditions with salespersons, and more.
* **Purchase** — This is the stage when a lead has already turned into a buyer, that is, has already bought a product or service from the company. Evaluating their buying intent doesn’t stop here, though. Companies that have obtained buyers will often try to retain them as regular customers, contacting them through various communication means (e-mail, phone, social media messages) to ask them for feedback and potentially try to promote similar products or services to those they’ve already bought.
* **Loyalty** — Finally, a buyer that the company has already managed to sell multiple products or services to can be considered a loyal customer. It’s much easier for companies to retain existing customers than invest resources in acquiring new leads and turning them into first-time customers. At this point, however, the intent of these buyers can shift back towards informational interest. Because of this, companies strive to show how much they value the loyalty of these buyers, by offering them benefits such as quality customer service, promotions, discounts, rewards, and more, which makes it likelier for them to commit to additional purchases and upgrades in the future.

### Summary

Buying intent, also known as purchase intent, is a term used to describe the probability of a person or organization buying a product or service from a company. Marketing teams evaluate buying intent by using predictive modelling, analyzing a variety of factors to determine how likely it is for particular groups of audiences to develop an interest in buying from the company.

Properly assessing buying intent is an important task for companies, because it can help them personalize their marketing campaigns, increase conversion rates, sell more products or services, improve cooperation between their marketing and sales teams, and more. That’s why marketers have created the concept of intent marketing — a specific kind of marketing that revolves around improving advertising campaigns and reducing the efforts of promoting products or services that certain interested buyers are already aware of.

Buying intent is related to the marketing funnel. At each stage of this funnel, potential buyers can display both buying intent and informational intent.

# What is Bookings

## Businesses can use several concepts revolving around their income when measuring their health and sales prospects.

When a customer pays for products or services, the company selling them can write down this income as revenue to account for, and cite it when evaluating the success of the business. However, when the company and the client agree on an amount to be paid in the future, it can’t be considered revenue yet — in such a case, businesses use concepts such as bookings to describe this kind of deal.

### Definition

The term bookings designates income that a business is due to receive by a customer in the future. Income from bookings is usually a result of some kind of a contract with the customer that promises to pay the business in return for their services.

Many of the details surrounding how bookings are measured can vary from company to company. This is because bookings aren’t defined by the [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles](https://www.accounting.com/resources/gaap/) (GAAP) — unlike revenues, for example, which designate a defined term referring to the income coming from a company’s financial activities.

Essentially, bookings are used to measure the value of a contract a business has with a customer. This isn’t necessarily a legally binding contract that has been signed, though — it could be any kind of commitment the customer has made to pay a defined amount to the company over a certain period of time.

Bookings, as a metric, represent a value measured in dollars, typically referring to either the [total contract value](https://gocardless.com/guides/posts/what-is-total-contract-value-tcv/) (TCV) or the [average contract value (ACV)](https://rev.team/kb/average-contract-value-acv) of a customer’s contract. They’re usually measured on a yearly level, even if the contracts they refer to last longer.

### Who Uses Bookings

As a metric, bookings commonly find their use in subscription-based businesses — companies relying on contracts with users that subscribe to their services and commit themselves to a periodic payment. The term is most often used in the [SaaS](https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-saas) economy.

Other examples of businesses that value bookings as a metric include:

* Startup subscription-based companies that aren’t familiar with more official accounting practices;
* Enterprise software distributors that offer software under license agreements;
* Advertising companies working on campaigns with insertion orders;
* And more.

### Why Are Bookings Important

Through bookings, companies measure the amounts of money they should expect from customers that have a contract with them. This helps them get a clearer idea of the demand for their products or services and how well the market accepts them.

As such, bookings are a valuable metric in finance. Coupled with other metrics such as annual recurring revenue (ARR), [customer acquisition cost](https://www.intercom.com/blog/what-is-customer-acquisition-cost/) (CAC), and [customer lifetime value](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/how-to-calculate-the-lifetime-value-of-a-customer-4173824), bookings help companies project their future financial situation and elaborate development strategies based on sound insights.

By properly measuring bookings, companies can better calculate their growth rate, which can, in turn, help them make sound decisions related to their expansion. A company’s evaluation of its bookings is what helps it put its monetary inflows and outflows into perspective. With this knowledge, companies are less likely to inflate their ARR and avoid financial miscalculations.

Another important feature of bookings is that it makes it possible for companies to account for the income they expect from customers without having to write it down as revenue in their spreadsheets. Accounting for expected payments as revenue would be wrong, because revenue can only be an income that the customer has already paid for after getting a product or a service from the company. As a matter of fact, even though bookings aren’t a revenue, not calculating them at all — much like writing them down as revenue — can be problematic for the company during an audit.

Positive engagements in a company’s bookings are always seen as a good sign. Therefore, increasing bookings is an important goal for a company’s production, marketing, and sales team, making them strive to increase their productivity to deliver a better experience to all customers that have a contract with the company.

### What Should Bookings Contain

Every income that a company expects in the form of revenue in the coming period — usually the following fiscal year — should be included in its bookings calculations. When measuring bookings, companies should consider:


* **New contracts** they sign, or unofficially agree upon, with customers;
* **Renewals** of existing contracts to extend their time period;
* **Upgrades** of existing contracts that envision an increase in payments from customers;
* **Downgrades** of existing contracts, meaning a decrease in future payments or churn.

On the other hand, there are certain items to exclude from bookings calculations as well, such as:

* **Set-up fees** that companies charge customers for setting up an account with them;
* **Credit adjustments** that reduce the customers’ invoices;
* **One-time charges** that customers pay but aren’t part of the contract or subscription;
* **Discounts** that companies may give to their customers
* And more.

These items shouldn’t be considered a part of the bookings because, while they do increase or decrease the actual revenue a company will get from their customer, they go beyond the purpose of the metric itself. Bookings only serve the purpose of tracking a company’s growth projection so that it can have a general idea of the direction in which it’s headed. They aren’t supposed to measure all of the company’s income for the following year, only to give it an insight into the value their customer contracts will bring them that same year.

### How to Calculate Bookings

Bookings are usually measured in dollars, as a net value of a signed contract. For calculating bookings, companies use the following equation:

**New contracts + Existing contracts’ expansions (renewals and upgrades) - Lost contracts (churn) = Net bookings**

### Summary

Companies use the concept of bookings to calculate amounts of money that customers commit to paying them for their products or services over the course of a designated period (usually a fiscal year). As such, bookings represent the value of customer contracts.

Subscription-based companies commonly use bookings. As a financial metric, bookings are important for giving companies an insight into its possibilities for growth.

However, the [base salary](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-base-salary) that employees earn, in the form of predetermined amounts of money, is not the only aspect of the payment that companies pay their workers. Instead, when an employer and an employee discuss working relations, the payment is often arranged in terms of compensation.

#### Definition

Compensation is the total payment, including benefits, that an employee receives from their employer. Compensation covers the basic salary employees are paid, as well as allowances, commissions, bonuses, health insurance, pension plans, paid leaves, stock options, and all other benefits wherever applicable.

Employers pay their employees compensation for their rendered work, services, or any other kind of contribution to their employers’ business or a particular project they work on. These contributions can be defined as the time employees spend on the project, their overall commitment to it, the professional knowledge or skills they offer that drive the project, and so on.

#### What Can Be Considered Compensation

When talking about compensation, the term is sometimes used as a synonym for wage or salary, but that isn’t an exact explanation of everything that compensation entails. Apart from direct payments that an employee receives as amounts of money, their compensation can also include other, non-cash payments as well.

With all this in mind, all of the following items can be considered a type of compensation:

* **Base pay** — This is the primary pay most employees get for their work or services. It’s the initial amount of money that an employee receives as a wage before deducting taxes and benefits from it.
* **Commission** — Another important type of compensation, commission constitutes an amount of money that employees get for fulfilling specific goals or reaching predetermined volumes, mostly used for rewarding salespersons. Commissions are usually paid as an addition to base salaries, although there are cases where the commission replaces the base pay and functions as an employee’s primary payment for their work or services.
* **Benefits** — This is a non-wage type of compensation that employers provide their employees as a kind of added value attached to their base pay. Benefits commonly include medical insurance, paid vacations, sick leaves, retirement, child care, and more.
* **Overtime pay** — This is the amount of money that employees get as additional compensation when they do [overtime](https://www.sage.com/en-us/blog/glossary/what-is-overtime/), that is, when they exceed their predetermined working hours for the day or week. This type of compensation can be applied to jobs that have working hours (such as 9 to 5) and fixed base salaries for working these hours.
* **Bonus pay** — Bonuses are payments that exceed the regular salary amounts that employees expect. Employers can offer this kind of compensation to reward employees that perform better, to attract top-talent professionals to sign a contract, to retain valued employees that may otherwise consider leaving the company, to reward employees who recommend valuable new candidates to the company, and more.
* **Shift differential pay** — This is a type of compensation paid to employees that work shifts deemed less desirable, usually night, or sometimes even evening shifts. Employers and employees usually agree upon a shift differential rate at which this compensation is paid as an addition to the regular salary.
* **Profit-sharing payments** — This kind of compensation is paid as part of [profit-sharing plans](https://www.thebalance.com/profit-sharing-plan-2894303), where companies share a part of their profits with their employees to help them save for retirement.
* **Merit pay** — Similar to commission, merit pay is a kind of compensation given to employees as a pay increase for their effective performance at work. It mostly applies to education and civil service jobs.
* **Incentive plan payments** — This kind of compensation is given to employees to incentivize them to perform better. It can be in the form of additional monetary payments as well as other non-cash rewards such as certificates, gift cards, merchandise, travel rewards in the form of paid trips, and more.
* **Tips** — Customary tips also count as employee compensation. This kind of compensation is common in service industries, with the most notable example of restaurants and bars.
* **Stock options** — Compensations can also come in the form of employee stock options (ESOs). These don’t represent stock shares, but rather derivative options of the company’s stock, allowing employees to buy stocks at a determined price for a determined time period.
* **Employee assistance programs** — Through these programs, employers offer their employees services such as counseling, referrals, legal advice, and more.
* **Allowances** — These compensations are added to the usual pay in order to facilitate an employee’s work for the company. More precisely, common allowance payments are often given out to satisfy an employee’s travel, meal, and housing needs.
* And more.

#### Why Is Compensation Important

Compensation is a key aspect of a business, especially when it comes to the employer-employee relationship. It is the stepping stone from which each business positions itself in the labor market. Quality compensation can help businesses grow in several ways.

Good compensations and bonuses can attract high-performing professionals to a business. In the long term, the investments businesses make in these compensations will pay off by the results that talented workers achieve for them.

Existing employees will also be motivated by good compensation plans. When rewarded with payments other than their base salary, employees have an incentive to increase their own productivity and generate more profits for their employers.

Knowing how to compensate talented employees will also increase their loyalty. A higher pay offered by a competitor can be a key reason for employees to leave their company and, therefore, additional compensation on top of their base salary can go a long way towards retaining them.

#### Summary

The term compensation is used to designate the total payments that employers pay their employees for rendering work, services, time, or any other value to the employee’s business or a particular project.

Different kinds of payments can constitute compensation, including the base salary, commissions, benefits, overtime pay, bonuses, shift differential pay, payments from profit-sharing and incentive plans, merit pay, tips, stock options, employee assistance program services rendered, allowances, and other cash and non-cash payments.

Compensation is a crucial aspect of a business’ work. It’s often the primary concern of job applicants and therefore, employees must consider their compensation packages very carefully when they position their businesses on the job market. A good compensation plan can help employers attract the most talented applicants, increase the productivity of their employees and make them more loyal.

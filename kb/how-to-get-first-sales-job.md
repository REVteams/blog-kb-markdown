### Building Your Career in Sales

#### Step 1: Define Your Career Goals

It is important to have clarity about where you want to go when you are done with your career. It will make everything else so much easier.

Ask yourself: What do you want to be when you are 50? Once you have the answer, think of how you can go back to that plan.

Interviews with salespeople are filled with people who want to be in management roles or closer to the enterprise.

If responses are so basic that they reveal that the candidate hasn't thought about what they want. From a management position, it will be a dice roll to hire them.

**TAKE ACTION:** Make a very concrete plan to achieve your goals. Think about *why* you want what you want.

#### Step 2: Choose the Right Company and Goal

You may not be a good fit in every sales role. Even if you love selling, you might find it more enjoyable to work at one company than another.

It is crucial to find the right company. Your career path will be determined by the companies you choose to join.

Some companies offer great salaries but drive you insane due to jerk bosses, products that fail customers, and crazy commute times.

Consider what is important to you and don't apply to companies that assume you only need sales experience, saying, I'll take what I can get."

**Here's an overview of the things you should pay attention to:**

* Do you resonate with the company's vision?
* Would you be willing to go to war for your CEO?
* Would you be willing to go to war for your direct boss? What about the boss?
* Would you like the office environment?
* Will you be *significantly* closer to your long-term career goals when it's time for you to leave that company?
* Will people be impressed by your work experience in the company or will they question it?
* Is the product disruptive?
* Are you happy with the compensation?
* Do people appear happy? (Note: I'm not referring to HR Recruiters or the hiring manager.)

**TAKE ACTION:** Make an "absolute must-have" list of the qualities you want to see in your first sales job. These are your deal-breakers. 

#### Step 3: Get the Job

Once you have a clear vision of your goals and where you are going, it's time for you to apply for the job.

You will need:

* A great resume.
* Spread the word that you are looking for a sales job.
* Lots of interviews, lots of practice interviewing.
* Continue to follow up until you hear a definite no or yes.

It's a market for employees. Companies can't find enough salespeople quickly, and unemployment is at an all-time low. But you know what? There is no shortage of *bad* talent!

Here are some tips to make you stand out:

* Do not wait to be contacted.
* Attach a cover letter to your official application. This is what less than 10% of my applicants do.
* If you are interested in the role, be creative: video, handwritten notes, and treats. When selling, you must stand out as if you are the actual role.
* Follow up.
* Don't ask questions that aren't relevant to your decision in an interview. For example, don't ask, "How are your onsite gym facilities?" 
* If you are still interested in the next steps, ask for them and verbally indicate your interest after the interview, phone screen, etc.
* Read books, blog posts, listen to podcasts, etc. You'll be known as a salesperson who is eager to learn.

**TAKE ACTION:** Create a list of questions that you can ask your interviewer.

#### Step 4: Excel in your Role

Now it's your turn to show them what you can do:

* The first 90 days are crucial for making impressions about work ethic, culture fit, and so forth; use your people skills.
* With no leads or old deals, you have an advantage. Keep your CRM clean and organized from day one.
* Introduce yourself to everyone. Ask for help from mentors or a sales trainer.
* Do not be afraid to fail. Accept your mistakes and work with your boss for improvement.
* Use a proven sales methodology. Find something that works and nail it.

**TAKE ACTION:** Get your mindset right. Visualize yourself as "all in" for your new job. Relax and then give it your best.

### Summary

Landing your first sales position means you made a great impression and stood out from the competition.

# What is Average Contract Value (ACV)

## One of the important things to measure for businesses — especially for those that function on the B2B model — is how many deals they can conclude with partners.

While the sheer amount of concluded deals is a clear sign that a company’s sales team can attract clients, which in turn increases revenue, companies are also interested in knowing the exact value each of these clients can bring them. The concept of average contract value exists for this purpose.

### Definition

An average contract value, or ACV, is the average revenue a company gets per customer. This value is commonly measured for a specific time period.

The term most often refers to the annually measured value of subscription-based contracts. In this case, it’s referred to as **annual contract value,** also abbreviated to ACV — logically so, since the average contract value is most commonly measured on a yearly basis and the terms are often conflated. On the other hand, when the revenue derived is not based on a subscription, but rather on multiple one-time payments, it’s called **average purchase value**, or APV.

### Average Purchase Value (APV)

APV is used to measure the average value a company gets from one of its customers by comparing all the individual transactions between the parties for a determined time period.

A company can calculate APVs either for the duration of the entire contract they have with that particular customer, or on a regular basis — every week, month, or year, depending on how regularly the customer makes individual purchases.

#### How to Calculate APV

To calculate APV for a specific customer, companies use the following formula:

**Total monetary value (\$) of transactions / Number of transactions for the determined period = APV ($)**

So, for example, if over one year, a single customer has made three individual purchases of **\$1000**, **\$2000**, and **\$6000** respectively, the total monetary value of all these would be **\$9000** (**\$1000 + \$2000 + \$6000 = \$9000**). As we have three transactions for the whole year, we divide this sum by three, and we get **\$9000 / 3 = \$3000**. This means that the company’s APV for that one customer for the designated year would be **$3000**.

### Annual Contract Value (ACV)

Annual contract value, or ACV, is the yearly average a company gets from a customer, based on a subscription contract the two parties have signed. While APV measures each individual transaction to determine an average, for measuring ACV a company needs to be paid in the form of periodical subscriptions.

With that in mind, ACV is mostly useful to businesses that rely on continuously selling their products or services in the form of subscriptions. A good example of such businesses would be [companies.](https://www.salesforce.com/in/saas/)

#### How to Calculate ACV

While there may be variations to how ACV is calculated, the general, most common formula uses the following equation:

**Total monetary value (\$) of the whole contract / Total contract length in years = ACV ($)**

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a customer has a three-year subscription contract with a company. The total value of the signed contract — that is, the full sum the customer pays for this three-year subscription — is **\$6000.** In this case, the company divides this sum by the number of years the contract lasts, and they get **\$6000 / 3 = \$2000.** So, the company’s ACV for that one customer for one year would be **$2000**.

### ACV and ARR

ACV is an important metric for measuring company health, much like the [annual recurring revenue, or ARR](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-annual-recurring-revenue-arr), that it closely resembles. The concepts of ARR and ACV are actually so similar, that companies often cannot make the difference.

In fact, the difference itself is really subtle. It mainly consists in that ARR designates the revenue a company expects to repeat from a company’s customers each year, while ACV, on the other hand, normalizes this yearly revenue applied to one or more particular years for each individual customer.

To make a comparison with examples, let’s say that a company has three customers:

* Customer n1 pays for a subscription of **$3000/year** for a one-year contract;
* Customer n2 pays **$2000/year** for 2 years; and
* Customer n3 pays **$1000/year** for 3 years;

To measure the **ACV** for these three customers, we take the total value of the contracts for each year and divide it by the total number of customers, meaning that:

* For the first year, all three customers are paying for the company’s subscription. To calculate the ACV for this year for these three customers, the company starts by taking the sum of all payments, which is **\$3000 + \$2000 + \$1000 = \$6000.** It then divides it by the number of customers and gets a value of **\$2000**  (**$6000/3**) is the ACV for the first year.
* For the second year, the ACV will drop, because the number of customers also drops from 3 to 2. Here, the second year’s ACV will be calculated as **(\$2000 + \$1000)/2 = $1500.**
* Finally, during the third year, the company will have a single customer that pays **\$1000**, which will also be that year’s ACV, as **\$1000/1 = $1000.**

When measuring the **ARR,** though, companies just calculate the sum of the annual revenue but don’t divide it by the number of customers. So, to measure the ARR:

* For the first year, during which all three customers are paying for the company’s subscription, the company simply calculates the sum of all payments, which is **\$3000 + \$2000 + \$1000 = \$6000.** In this case, **$6000** is the ARR for the first year.
* For the second year, the ARR lowers because the company has lost a customer. The ARR will be **\$2000 + \$1000 = $3000** for year two.
* In the third year, when the company will have a single customer left, the ARR will simply be the amount that this customer pays, which is **$1000.**

### Why Is ACV Important

As there are already many ways to measure average revenues — ARR being a notable example — ACV may seem like just another one of these. However, when compared to other subscription-related metrics, ACV can give businesses important insights for making future plans and strategies.

Companies that work with subscriptions don’t necessarily depend on a very high ACV to thrive. However, comparing their ACV to their [customer acquisition cost (CAC)](https://www.intercom.com/blog/what-is-customer-acquisition-cost/) and [customer churn](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-customer-churn) rate puts it into perspective for future business plans.

For example, companies with a lower ACV can still be successful if they have a very low CAC as well. Since their costs to acquire new customers are low, they don’t have to worry about the ACV for each customer. They’ll depend on the number of customers they have, instead of the quality (meaning the ACV) they get from them.

### Summary

An average contract value (ACV) designates the average monetary value a customer contributes to a company for a designated time period. It’s usually calculated as either an annual contract value (ACV) for measuring yearly subscription revenue or an average purchase value (APV) for measuring single transaction averages.

For companies, measuring ACV is useful when coupled with other metrics that the subscription economy uses. Combining these helps businesses make sound decisions on how to base their future business and marketing strategies.

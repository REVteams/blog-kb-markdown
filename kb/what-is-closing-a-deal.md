As a common practice, to finalize a sale, businesses have to close a deal with their customers first.

#### Definition

Closing a deal, in sales terminology, refers to the process of completing a sale, when the prospect (or customer) finally agrees to pay for a product or service sold by a business. In practice, deal closing usually requires the initiative of salespersons — and oftentimes their continuous efforts and expertise in closing a sale as well.

#### Deal Closing and the Sales Funnel

Closing a deal is a pivotal stage in the sales funnel — a visualization tool used by sales teams to demonstrate the entirety of the sales process. The sales funnel is a linear representation of the sales process, including multiple steps that demonstrate each phase of this process — from drawing the attention of a potential prospect to a product or service to delivering the same product/service to the prospect who has bought it and become a customer.

With this in mind, closing the deal is considered part of the very last step of the sales funnel. All other steps a prospect or customer goes through — becoming aware of the product/service, showing interest in it, considering a purchase, showing intent to buy it, evaluating it — lead up to the purchase step, which is considered the most desirable and sought after of all steps for sales representatives.

The purchase step (or phase) of the sales funnel is when the prospect turned customer is already buying the product or service in question. The purchase itself implies that a salesperson has already closed a deal with said customer.

#### The Challenge of Closing a Deal

Deal closing often takes a lot of effort, negotiation, and convincing (potential customers). This process can often be very demanding and even exhausting, especially for sales representatives with less experience in their field.

To get to the final stage of closing a deal, a salesperson often has to research their prospect, engage them with the aim of attracting them to the product or service they want to sell them, get to know them better to get insight into their specific needs and desires that they can then use to close the sale, and likely engage in many other sales-related activities in between.

At the end of it all, the salesperson will likely still face the possibility of rejection by their prospect — the party which ultimately carries the final decision on the purchase. If the prospect does reject the purchase and the deal fails to close, this outcome can be very discouraging and even frustrating for salespersons that went through all the leg work to close the deal — especially when they’re less experienced.

All this makes deal closing a real challenge, even for the simplest and smallest sale. This is why sales representatives and teams often spend a lot of time developing their deal closing strategies, which is considered extremely important for successful businesses. The most experienced sales pros often guide themselves by the [Always be closing (ABC)](https://www.checkli.com/checklists/anthonycaliendo/abc-always-be-closing-checklist-for-sales-success) principle.

#### Deal Closing Techniques

Different salespeople will often use different approaches to close deals, depending on the nature of their prospects and how well acquainted they are with their needs. When devising and picking their closing phrases, sales representatives have to adapt themselves to the approach that’s most likely to appeal to each prospect.

Some of the most common techniques sales representatives use to close deals include:

* **Trial close** — This closing technique is used when a salesperson presumes that a prospect isn’t ready to purchase the product or service they’re promoting, usually through reading their body language. Trial closes often imply asking the prospect how they feel about the information they’ve received, or any other indirect question meant to test their readiness without extracting a final ‘yes’ or ‘no’ from them. Oftentimes, prospects will have objections to a trial close question, to which salespersons are meant to respond affirmatively, thereby leading the prospects closer to the final deal close.
* **Multiple choices close** — When using this technique, salespersons circumvent the subject of the deal closing to offer their prospects options related to the delivery of the product or service instead. For example, a salesperson can ask their prospect if they prefer a green or a red bike, or if they prefer to pay for the service they offer on a monthly or a yearly basis, and so on. This approach is often alternatively called the **minor point close**, as salespeople using it try to get their prospects to agree on a minor point related to the product or service they’re selling them as a means of getting them closer to closing a deal.
* **Suggestion close** — This is a close used by salespersons that have already instilled a sense of trust in their prospects. Based on the knowledge they have of their prospects, salespersons can then suggest details regarding the product or service to them as a means of leading them towards closing a deal. For instance, salespersons can offer their prospects a particular product or feature that most customers from the same background buy, or a service useful for the project they’re currently working on, and so on.
* **Now-or-never close** — This approach relies on pressuring prospects into agreeing on a deal out of urgency. Limited time offers and discounts are a common example of this, wherein prospects or customers will be pressured into making a quick decision before the promotion expires. This approach is usually used by salespersons that have already established good relationships with their customers and [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client).
* **Assumptive close** — This type of close is used when a salesperson can assume with higher certainty that their prospect will agree to a deal. In such cases, salespersons can close the deal by asking their prospect or customer questions such as when they want their product or service delivered, what payment method they prefer, and so on.

#### Summary

Closing a deal is the process of finalizing a sale, wherein a prospect or customer has agreed to purchase a product or service provided by a business. Closing a deal is part of the final stage of the sales funnel, and is most often a step that precedes every purchase.

As deals rarely ever close themselves, they usually require efforts on the part of salespersons. The process of closing a deal can be a real challenge, especially for less experienced salespersons, often facing the potentially frustrating effects of deal rejection as well. This is why sales teams often invest a lot of time and effort into developing and improving their deal closing strategies. The most experienced sales pros usually work by the Always be closing (ABC) principle.

Some of the most common techniques used by salespersons to close sales include the trial close, the multiple choices (or minor point) close, the suggestion close, the now-or-never close, the assumptive close, and more.

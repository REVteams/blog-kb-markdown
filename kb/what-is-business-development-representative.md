# What is Business Development Representative

## The term business development is used to describe a company’s plan on how to grow and increase its revenue. This includes the company’s strategy on how to take advantage of business opportunities that enable it to gain new paying customers.

This whole process depends on the effort of a number of the company’s employees working in different positions — one of them being the business development representative.

### Definition

A company’s business development representative (BDR) is a specialist focusing on finding new prospects, establishing foundational relationships, and refreshing the sales pipeline with new leads for [account executives (AEs)](https://rev.team/kb/account-executive-ae).

The primary domain of BDRs is sales. In companies, BDRs are tasked with generating leads for AEs to close, effectively converting them into customers. Apart from this role, details on what the BDR and similar positions include can vary from company to company. In most cases, the term is used interchangeably with that of a sales development representative, or SDR.

### SDRs and BDRs

Both SDRs and BDRs work in a company’s sales team, and their job is essentially the same — they both work with leads to enable their eventual conversion into paying customers by account executives.

In the business world, definitions for these terms are not set in stone. Therefore, while the general goal of BDRs and SDRs is the same, and some companies will use the terms interchangeably for the same positions, others can make a clearer difference between the two, and even hire a separate BDR and SDR.

For companies that do distinguish between SDRs and BDRs, the difference usually comes down to the type of leads these work with. In this case, BDRs are usually assigned to work on outbound leads — that is, they’re supposed to reach out to potential leads, as opposed to SDRs that will only work with inbound leads that have already approached the company themselves.

In any case, BDRs and SDRs don’t usually have the task of closing business with the leads — only moving those leads they consider adequate further down the pipeline, so AEs can eventually close business with them and convert them into paying customers. An exception to this rule would be a company that doesn’t hire separate employees for doing the function of SDRs, BDRs, or AEs, and instead has a single employee to both bring in leads and convert them to customers.

### What Does a BDR Do?

As part of the sales team, BDRs are responsible for the very first step in the sales process — [prospecting](https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/prospecting). This term refers to the process of finding potential customers, also called **prospects.**

Essentially, BDRs are tasked with attracting the attention of prospects with the aim of promoting the company’s products or services to them. This first step should facilitate gaining these leads as customers.

Because of the fact that BDRs don’t actually seal deals with new customers, their contribution is often less visible in favor of that of their salesperson counterparts. However, this doesn’t make them less important for the company — on the contrary, BDRs often set the whole sales process with a customer in motion in the first place, because they can find prospects that a company would likely miss out on without their efforts.

As BDRs work with outbound leads, they’re useful for smaller companies that have reached a stage where they can expand their business further. These companies usually hire BDRs to assist them in the process of [scaling](https://www.lightercapital.com/blog/what-is-scaling-in-business/).

A BDRs work consists of multiple tasks, including:

* **Researching** — When trying to attract potential customers, BDRs should be aware of their interests, preferences, needs, fears, and so on. For this purpose, BDRs should be excellent researchers. Gathering data on target audience demographics will make up a significant part of their work.
* **Generating leads** — This process includes the creation of contact lists and gathering prospect details. For this purpose, BDRs can use existing databases created by third companies, which can be very helpful in reducing the time this task takes.
* **Reaching out to prospects** — BDRs often use [cold outreach](https://blog.chartmogul.com/cold-outreach/), including writing cold emails, and even doing cold calls, to establish a connection with their target prospects. While this is not a tactic most potential customers prefer, when it comes to closing business deals for companies, it often works. A skillful BDR will know how to make the most out of it.
* **Using social networks** — Social media connects the world like never before, and this provides great opportunities to companies looking to attract customers. BDRs, as part of the company’s sales team, will be using these platforms to promote the business wherever they consider they can find leads, usually in social media groups. This task is best done subtly, and BDRs shouldn’t be too pushy in their promotion. They’ll commonly use their personal social media profiles in order to personalize the promotion of their company by engaging in various groups and discussions first, gaining the trust of their prospects before they can attract their interest to what the company can offer them.
* And more.

### Skills

As the tasks that BDRs get assigned are very specific, they also require some particular skills. These include:

* **Communication skills** — Because of the nature of their work, a BDRs ability to connect with prospects will be crucial to their success. Companies usually hire individuals that excel at establishing personal connections for this position.
* **Creativity** — As increasing amounts of companies try to attract new customers, BDRs have to be creative in their approach to make sure they can really connect with each individual they target and avoid being perceived as just another advertiser.
* **Patience** — Reaching out to prospects doesn’t always bear fruit immediately, and sometimes not at all. This is why BDRs need to be very patient and persistent. For some prospects, it will take several cold emails or calls before they can finally show interest in a company.
* **Active listening** — While BDRs do need to be communicative, they will rarely ever be doing the bulk of the talking. On the contrary, BDRs should be skilled at asking open-ended questions, and actively listen to the prospects when they respond to these. This will create an atmosphere of trust between the two parties, and will ultimately help the BDR get to know their prospects better and focus on a more personalized approach to attract them.
* And more.

### Summary

Business development representatives help companies acquire prospects that they can convert into customers. In this sense, they’re similar to sales development representatives.

As part of their jobs, BDRs do research on their prospects, engage in cold outreach, generate leads, and use social media. BDRs are communicative, creative, and patient individuals that know how to actively listen to their prospects.

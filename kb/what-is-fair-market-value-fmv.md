For each commercial transaction, a [buyer](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) purchasing an item pays a seller a certain price for it — usually predetermined by the sellers themselves, which sometimes allow for negotiations on it. In any case, determining prices for items being sold can sometimes be a challenging task — one concept that aims to help all parties involved in this process is known as fair market value, or FMV for short.

#### Definition

Fair market value (FMV) is a term used to describe a price for which an item would sell on an open market, generally considered to be fair. FMV is typically a legal category, regulated by law, and often used in the areas of property tax, real estate, insurance, and more.

#### Background

In the United States, the [Internal Revenue Code (IRC)](https://irc.bloombergtax.com/), which is the U.S. domestic federal statutory tax law, often uses the term FMV in its sections. Apart from the IRC, other federal statutory laws in the USA, such as state laws and bankruptcy laws, also use this term.

For an item’s price to be considered FMV, it should fulfill certain conditions. These include:

* Both parties (buyer and seller) should know the relevant facts about the item being traded;
* Both parties should be willing to engage in a transaction;
* Both parties should be free of any pressure to make the trade, and neither the buyer nor the seller should be forced to engage in it against their own will;
* The transaction should serve the best interests of both parties;
* The transaction shouldn’t be rushed to the point where the buying party doesn’t have enough time to make an important decision in relation to the purchase.

If all the above conditions are met, the price upon which the buying and the selling party agree can be considered FMV.

#### FMV vs. Market Value vs. Appraised Value

FMV is often compared to other similar terms used to determine the value of items for sale, such as [market value](https://www.ig.com/en/glossary-trading-terms/market-value-definition) and [appraised value](https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/a/appraised-value/). While all these concepts serve a similar purpose, there’s still a clear distinction between the three of them.

The term market value, for instance, is used in reference to the value of an item, asset, or business on the financial market, determined by the participants in this marketplace. As opposed to this, the FMV price of an item is determined on the basis of free, open market activity, involving both the buying and the selling party directly engaged in the transaction of said item, rather than third-party members of the marketplace this item would be placed in. This means that anyone can usually find the market value of an item they’re interested in on a listing, while its FMV can’t simply be found listed somewhere — it has to be agreed upon by both parties engaging in a transaction over it.

Likewise, an item’s appraised value is also different from its FMV. The term appraised value is used for assets, typically in the field of real estate, much like FMV. The difference between the two, however, is that an appraised value for a specific asset is determined by licensed or certified appraisers which specialize in determining the price of real estate properties. The FMV of a real estate property, on the other hand, is agreed upon by both the seller and the buyer — it doesn’t specifically require the appraisal of an appraiser. However, it’s worth noting that, when determining the FMV, buyers and sellers can actually consult appraisers, too. Oftentimes, in such cases, the appraisal is sufficient for both parties (the buyer and the seller of an asset) to settle for an FMV equivalent to the asset’s appraised value.

#### Where Is FMV Used

Perhaps the most common usage for FMV, as stipulated above, is for settling real estate prices between buyers and sellers of a particular asset, such as a house, an apartment, and so on. To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a homeowner puts their house up for sale at a starting price of \$200,000, and a prospective buyer shows up, offering them \$180,000 for it. After a process of negotiation, both parties eventually settle for $192,000. This price will constitute the FMV of this particular house, as agreed upon by both parties involved in its transaction.

Similarly, the concept of an FMV can also be used in several situations that require legal guidance. For instance, divorce property settlements are commonly resolved by using an FMV agreed upon by both parties to a divorce. Another example of legal use for an FMV is when the U.S. government wants to take private property for public use (filing an [eminent domain](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/eminent_domain) action), wherein the owners of said private property are granted just compensation by a court, typically in the form of an FMV of the property agreed upon by the owners.

Another common use for the concept of FMV is in taxation. For instance, after a loss produced by the destruction of private property, an FMV is agreed upon with the property’s owner when determining the value of the damaged property for a tax deduction for it. Homeowners are also commonly consulted to determine an FMV for their property when assessing the value of its municipal property tax.

The insurance industry is another sector that often uses FMV to settle claims. When insured property is damaged and the owner of said property makes a claim to their insurance company to compensate them for the damage, the company in question will usually consult the owner to determine an FMV for this property upon which to base the damage coverage.

#### Summary

Fair market value (FMV) is a term that describes the fair price of items sold on an open market. The concept of FMV is typically regulated by law and used in areas such as real estate, taxation, insurance, and more.

FMV is often used by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as well as other U.S. statutory laws, such as state laws and bankruptcy laws.

For an item’s determined price to be considered FMV, it has to fulfill certain conditions. These conditions are: both parties (the buyer and the seller) should be aware of relevant facts about the item being traded, they should both engage in the transaction willingly, none of them should be pressured into engaging in it, it should serve the interests of both, and the buying party should be given enough time to make important decisions related to the purchase.

The concept of FMV is often compared to similar ones, such as market value and appraised value. The difference between the three is that an item’s market value is determined by the participants of the marketplace it’s being sold on, its appraised value is determined by licensed or certified appraisers, whereas its FMV can be simply set by its buyer and seller.

Real estate prices are commonly agreed upon by sellers and buyers of property, often via negotiation. The concept of FMV is also often used in situations that require legal mediation, such as divorce settlements and eminent domain actions. FMV is also often used to determine property tax — for instance, when determining the value of a tax deduction of a damaged private property, or when setting municipal property taxes. The insurance industry often uses the concept of FMV as well, particularly when owners of insured property make claims for damage coverage.

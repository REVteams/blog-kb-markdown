# What are C-Level (C-Suite) Executives

## A company’s hierarchy usually consists of different positions exercising different levels of authority over each other. In the majority of cases, company founders and boards of directors are at the top, and below them are C-Level (C-Suite) executives.

#### Definition

C-Level executives — also known as C-Suite executives (CXOs) — are senior position holders that have strategically important roles in a company. They are chief executives (which is what the C in C-Level stands) that lead entire departments within the companies they work for.

#### Requirements

C-Level executives comprise the most important echelon within a company, exerting more influence than anyone else working for it. Becoming a C-Level executive is a highly sought-after achievement.

Such an important and influential position requires tremendous experience and time spent working in their field. C-Level executives that act as heads of a department are usually experts possessing high-level knowledge of the particular branch of business they’re in charge of.

Except for the expertise in their fields, C-Level executives should all have certain common skills to match the gravity of positions they occupy. Some of these skills include:

* The ability to think strategically;
* Conflict management;
* [Change management](https://www.prosci.com/resources/articles/what-is-change-management); 
* Leadership skills;
* Decision-making skills;
* Critical thinking;
* And more.

Lower-level employees aiming for C-Level positions should acquire all these skills throughout their professional development to have a chance at joining the ranks of their company’s chief executives.

#### C-level Executive Types

Different companies across all business sectors can have different hierarchical structures, and the names for each position within them may vary. However, the designated C-Level positions are usually used by all companies regardless of their field of work.

### Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

The CEO is the executive holding the highest position within a company’s hierarchy. These executives are in charge of managing all of the company’s business operations. A CEO is a company’s top decision-maker and the main driving force behind its success.

Usually, the CEO is the go-to person when anyone refers to the leadership of the company. The CEO is the face of their company in public relationships. In fact, it’s often the case that a company’s founder or co-founder is also its CEO.

CEOs consult all other C-Level executives within the company when it comes to making strategic decisions. The other C-Level executives are also obliged to file reports related to their work in their respective departments to the CEO.

Statistically, CEOs can have different professional backgrounds and experiences, not limited to a particular field or company department. They should, however, have gained significant amounts of leadership and decision-making skills throughout their professional development process to be able to properly assume such a responsible position.

### Chief Operating Officer (COO)

In most cases, COOs are right below CEOs in a company’s command structure. A COO serves as the company’s human resources (HR) executive. 

The task of the COO is to make sure all of the company’s operations, strategies, and business plans run as they’re intended to. The overall functioning of a company’s business is the responsibility of its COO.

COOs should come from a professional background in the fields of employee recruitment, training, administrative work, payroll, legal services, and the like. 

### Chief Financial Officer (CFO)

A company’s financial department is run by a CFO. These executives manage the company’s financial status and are in charge of its budgeting, risk analysis, and financial reports. 

CFOs give CEOs advice when it comes to new business opportunities that the company can take advantage of. They specialize in evaluating the potential benefits and risks of each financial enterprise the company wishes to undertake.

Employees having worked as financial analysts or accountants can apply for CFO positions within a company working in the financial sector. Experience in fields such as investment research and portfolio management is also a characteristic of CFOs and applicants for the position. 

### Chief Marketing Officer (CMO)

A CMO is an executive in charge of a company’s marketing strategy and campaigns. This can include activities in the fields of advertising, digital marketing, placing the company’s products or services on the market, and more.

Employees having worked as sales or marketing representatives are the ones most likely to be promoted to CMOs. The position highly relies on experience in social innovations as well as product development.

### Chief Technology Officer (CTO)

A CTO caters to the technological needs of their company. CTOs are charged with research and development tasks, implementing new systems, maintaining the company’s tech infrastructure, and the like.

Companies often have **Chief Information Officers (CIOs)** that serve as a particular type of CTOs focusing on their IT technologies. In case a company has both a CTO and a CIO, it usually means that its CTO is tasked with creating new technology for it, while its CIO particularly focuses on maintaining the proper functioning of the company’s internal IT infrastructure. 

These executives should be experienced in the particular technological fields their departments are based around. For instance, IT experts are often recruited as CIOs.

### Chief Data Officer (CDO)

Chief data officers (CDOs) are among the latest kinds of CXOs to have emerged in business hierarchies. CDOs are in charge of data usage and management in the companies that employ them. 

CDOs are usually recruited among employees (or even individuals not working for the company at the moment) with experience in data analytics and management, such as data scientists. Alternatively, employees from marketing backgrounds can also apply for CDO positions.  

### Chief Revenue Officer (CRO)

When it comes to revenue generation responsibilities, some companies have also recently started employing chief revenue officers (CROs) in charge of ensuring long-term profitability in terms of revenue. Typically, a company’s CRO enables all revenue-related departments in it (such as sales, marketing, pricing, client care, etc.) to better work together.

Individuals who are highly skilled in business management and finance are recruited as CROs. Any employees that have experience in high-level financial positions are fit for this role. 

#### Summary

C-Level or C-Suite executives are high-ranking employees assuming key strategic positions within a company. They are senior executives in charge of entire company departments, and they’re considered to be the most important individuals within the company’s hierarchy.

C-Level positions are the most responsible, influential, and sought-after by employees aiming to advance in rank. As C-Level positions are the most important ones in a company’s hierarchy, they require high levels of experience and skills in leadership, decision-making, critical and strategic thinking, conflict and change management, and more.

Common C-Level positions across all business sectors include Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), Chief Operating Officers (COOs), Chief Financial Officers (CFOs), Chief Marketing Officer (CMOs), Chief Technology Officers (CTOs) or Chief Information Officers (CIOs), Chief Revenue Officers (CROs), Chief Data Officers (CDOs), and more.

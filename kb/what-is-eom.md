## When doing business, companies often deal with deadlines they have to meet in order to function, turn in revenues and make profits.

Therefore, in business theories, there exist many terms and concepts related to deadlines and time periods related to business operations. One such concept — particularly important for the processes of [closing sales](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal) and [compensating](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-compensation) employees — is known as end-of-month, or EOM for short.

#### Definition

End-of-month (EOM) is a term used in sales to refer to a deadline, commonly set at the exact time when a month ends (as the name suggests), before which a business’s sales team members have to reach a particular sales quota — that is, close a specified number of sales — usually predetermined by the business’s management at the beginning of the month in question.

Apart from sales, the term is often used in accounting, as well. EOM in accounting, as a monthly deadline, is related to particular procedures that a business has to complete by the end of the month in order to have all their financial obligations for the month fulfilled. Common examples of such procedures include paying salaries to employees, receiving payments for items sold, and more.

#### Meeting EOM Deadlines in Sales

Setting up EOM quotas helps businesses motivate their employees in the sales department to be more productive. The payment of a salesperson’s [commission](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-commission) commonly depends on whether they’ll meet their quotas by the predetermined EOM deadline, and to what extent. This means that it’s in their best interest to close as many sales as possible in order to receive higher pay at the end of the month.

Meeting EOM deadlines can be a challenging task. However, salespersons that stick with their predetermined direction and do their best to avoid mistakes are more than likely to do a great job at fulfilling their EOM quotas. There are also several aspects of their work they can focus on in order to improve their chances of closing sales.

### Choosing the Right Prospects to Focus On

When working with deadlines, as is the case with EOM quotas, some salespeople can be tempted to reach out to as many [leads and prospects](https://www.hipb2b.com/blog/lead-prospect-whats-difference) as they can find and as fast as possible, with the hope that at least some of these will eventually settle for a purchase. In reality, this often leads to these salespeople wasting their time and not closing nearly enough deals as they should. The proper approach would be to locate only those prospects that are most likely to buy a product or service and focus only on them, regardless of the pressure from the deadline. In practice, focusing on the right prospects results in an increase in sales and meeting EOM quotas more often than not.

### Minding The Timing

While it’s important to choose the right targets for a [sales pitch](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/sales-pitch), choosing the right time can also be a decisive factor for closing sales and meeting the EOM quota. For a salesperson, a good example of good sales timing would be the time when most of their [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) and prospects receive their salaries or profits — which is usually during or around the EOM period for their own businesses. After having located the most opportune time to pitch for a sale, salespersons can use different selling techniques such as promotions, discounts, and more, to create an even more attractive sales offer for their prospects or clients.

### Asking the Right Questions

When talking to a client or prospect, salespeople often take the time to promote the products or services they’re trying to sell. However, successful sales professionals know that asking their prospects the right questions is also crucial for closing sales. [Open-ended questions](https://spotio.com/blog/open-ended-sales-questions/), commonly used during sales processes such as [discovery calls](https://rev.team/kb/discovery-call), are used by sales professionals to help them learn more about the prospects they’re trying to sell to, with the aim of acquiring information about them that they can use in favor of closing the sale.

### Not Pressuring Prospects Into Buying

Giving prospects the space they need to express themselves during a sales pitch is a step in the right direction, which is a part of making them feel generally at ease while talking to a salesperson. This means that a sales professional knows how to control the need for aggressiveness when trying to close more sales and meet a particular quota before a deadline. Pressuring prospects into making a purchase can be off-putting, and, in the worst case, can also backfire and make them lose interest in the deal altogether. Because of this, professional salespersons know their own boundaries when talking to prospects during a sales pitch.

#### EOM in Accounting

Similar to sales, the concept of EOM is also widely used in accounting. EOM accounting is a term that refers to financial processes (operations and reports) that a business must complete before the end of the month. When all these processes have been done, the business can focus on its obligations for the following month.

One of the key processes that are part of EOM accounting is when businesses collect revenue and incur costs at the end of the month. Here, monthly revenue mostly includes the money for payments that businesses receive through their main financial activities — usually from selling products and/or services — but can also include other financial gains depending on the nature of the business, such as fees paid, interest, subscription payments, and more. The monthly expenses (or costs incurred) can include items such as salaries and wages paid, [cost of goods sold (COGS)](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-cost-of-goods-sold-cogs), utility expenses, repair and maintenance costs, rent, supplies, sales and marketing expenses, bank charges, accounting fees, legal fees, interest paid, and more. Both revenues and expenses are usually registered each month and are therefore important for EOM accounting.

In some cases, companies have to make some adjustments to their EOM accounting reports because of unforeseen monthly revenues or expenses. For instance, companies commonly pay a fixed, predetermined monthly sum in wages to their employees by transferring it to them through bank transfer. However, if the bank decides to raise its commission that month, this will cost the business an additional, unexpected sum on top of what it already foresaw for the month. In such cases, the business’s accountant has to make adjustments to their ledger entry to add the unexpected expense incurred by the bank’s raised commission to the previous sum.

After making adjustments, accountants have to calculate the balances of all accounts held by the businesses that employ them. The next step for accountants to take is to record the results in the accounting databases that the businesses maintain, and come up with EOM reports describing the financial situation of these businesses, which they submit to their managers.

#### Summary

End-of-month, or EOM, is a term that’s often used in sales and accounting. In sales, EOM refers to a monthly deadline for salespersons to fulfill their sales quotas, commonly pre-determined at the beginning of the month. EOM accounting, on the other hand, refers to the sum of processes that businesses have to complete before the monthly deadline, in relation to the financial obligations they have.

EOM deadlines in sales are often used to motivate salespersons to increase their performance, as the commissions they receive as payment often depend on whether they’ll meet their EOM quotas and to what extent. To increase their number of sales closed and fulfill predetermined EOM quotas, sales professionals can use a number of techniques such as focusing on those prospects that are most likely to commit to a purchase, choosing the right timing for a sales pitch, asking prospects the right questions to get information relevant to the sales process, setting their boundaries while promoting products or services in order not to appear as if they’re pressuring prospects into buying, and more.

EOM accounting revolves around the process of accountants completing procedures and filing reports related to a business’s revenue (usually from sales) as well as expenses (salaries, utilities, rent, cost of goods sold (COGS), sales and marketing expenses, interest, accounting fees, legal fees, and more). In case of unexpected changes in income and expenses, accountants have to make adjustments to their EOM entries, calculate the balances of each account held by the business, write an EOM report and file it to the business’s management.

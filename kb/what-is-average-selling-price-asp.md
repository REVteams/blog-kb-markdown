Marketing teams in companies carefully consider how they set prices, having many important aspects of the trade in mind.

As the task of picking the right price can get tricky, there are several metrics to help businesses out. One of those metrics is the average selling price.

### Definition

An average selling price, or ASP, is — as the name itself suggests — the average price that a product or service sells at on the market. Companies that sell services and products usually measure and report on their ASPs regularly.

Concepts similar to that of ASP, specific to different industries, may also be found throughout the business sector. For example, in [eCommerce](https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/what-is-ecommerce), where businesses deal with online orders, the metric known as **average order value** (AOV) is more commonly used than ASP. In the [lodging sector](https://archive.epa.gov/airquality/community/web/html/lodging_sector_addl_info.html), as another example, concepts such as the **average daily rate** or **average room rate** are used instead. When it comes to [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/) companies, the term **average revenue per account** (ARPA) is usually used as a replacement for ASP and is calculated as the average amount new clients pay the first time they first sign up for a subscription. All these are tightly connected to ASP but don’t always have the same function.

### How To Calculate ASP

The common formula for calculation ASP is pretty simple:

**Total revenue from selling products or services / Number of products or services sold = ASP**

As an example, let’s take a company selling personal computers. To calculate its ASP for their computers for each year, the company needs to take the total revenue they’ve had from selling computers throughout the whole year, and then divide it by the total number of computers sold that same year.

Let’s say the company has sold **5,000** computers at **\$300** each, **15,000** computers at **\$400** each, and **10,000** computers at **$500** each. Let’s calculate what their average selling price was.

To start with, we need to calculate the company’s total revenue from selling computers, by adding up all the revenue from the units sold for different prices:

**5,000 x \$300 = \$1,500,000**
**15,000 x \$400 = \$6,000,000**
**10,000 x \$500 = \$5,000,000**
**\$1,500,000 + \$6,000,000 + \$5,000,000 = $12,500,000**

This means that the company’s total revenue from selling computers that year was $12,500,000. From here, the company needs to divide this number by the total of computers sold, which we’ll calculate by adding up the three totals we already have:

**5,000 + 15,000 + 10,000 = 30,000**

30,000 is the total number of computers the company sold throughout the year. From here, we can finally calculate the ASP for that year with the following formula:

**\$12,500,000 / 30,000 = $416.66**

From this, we can conclude that the company’s ASP for their computers for that year is **$416.66.**

### Examples of ASPs

Different products and services on the market have different ASPs, depending on several factors.

For example, one of the factors that drive up ASP is production cost. Things like the latest technology gadgets (computers, smart devices, and so on) will have a high ASP, and so will things like precious gems and gold jewellery, for example. As it is costly to produce these, which can be for various reasons — paying for skilled labour when it comes to technology and the sheer rarity of precious materials that drives their prices up — they tend to have higher ASPs than, say, everyday clothes that are cheap to produce.

On the other hand, other factors may drive these products’ ASPs down as well. For example, if a smartphone model is nearing the end of its life cycle, its ASP will be significantly lower than what it was at the beginning.

### Why Is ASP Important

Companies in all kinds of sectors that deal with sales use ASP measurements. However, high-volume businesses, such as those working in retail and technology distribution, are the ones that use it most frequently.

Oftentimes, these businesses specify their ASPs in their quarterly earnings reports. Business analysts can then evaluate the company’s overall success by having the ASPs of the various products and services they sell in mind. If a company displays favourable trends through its ASPs, it can attract more investors as well.

ASP’s for products and services that have already been measured by one company can also be used by other companies. New businesses that plan to sell the same product or service, as well as existing ones, can check this company’s ASPs and use it as a **benchmark price** for making an educated decision on how to set their own prices.

To figure out what an ideal ASP for its products or services would be, a company’s marketing department must carefully consider its placement options in the marketplace. If they wish to promote and sell their products or services as high-quality options, they will aim for a higher ASP and set a higher price for their products accordingly. As opposed to this approach, if a company focuses more on selling a larger quantity of products or services rather than their quality, they will usually want to sell them cheaper and set a lower ASP for them.

### Summary

An average selling price (ASP) is the average price at which a product or service is sold. ASP is calculated as the total revenue divided by the total number of all products or services sold.

A company’s ASP reports let analysts and investors evaluate the company’s potential in the market. ASPs measured by a particular company can also serve as benchmark prices for other companies that aim to sell the same products or services and want to get an idea at what prices they can place them on the market.

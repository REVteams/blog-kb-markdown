# What is a General Manager?

## Most businesses and companies have a well-established structure within their workforce, often following a determined hierarchy of relations between their employees.

In order to be functional, it’s standard practice for the majority of companies — and especially so for larger ones — to hire [managers](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-a-manager) in charge of supervising parts (or the whole) of their businesses. There are different kinds of managers with different amounts of responsibility for company operations, one of them being the general manager, or GM for short.

#### Definition

A company’s general manager (GM) is in charge of the operations of a department or the whole company, particularly for the revenue and cost elements of its [income statement](https://www.zoho.com/books/guides/what-is-an-income-statement.html). Apart from daily business operations, general managers typically manage most or all of the company’s sales and marketing efforts, as well.

#### Who Can Be a General Manager

Small and medium-sized companies often have their highest executives in the role of general managers. For larger companies with a more extensive hierarchy, the general managers are superior to all other employees except for those at the very top corporate level such as the founder, CEO, or the board of directors. Depending on the type of company they work for and its internal structure, the responsibilities and significance of the general manager will be different.

Within a company’s hierarchy, holders of different titles can assume the role of general managers. Most commonly, among [C-Level executives](https://rev.team/kb/c-level-c-suite-executives), the CEO is the one that’s considered the general manager of all company operations, and superior to all other managers. 

Different branches within a company can also have their own general managers, which oversee particular processes within their assigned departments. These general managers are ranked right behind CEOs in the company’s hierarchy. As the CEO is considered the overall general manager of all company departments, other general managers are in charge of particular lines of business. 

Some of the titles held by general managers of different business branches include:

* **Product manager** — the general manager at a technology company;
* **Branch manager** — the general manager of a bank branch;
* **Managing director** — service sector or consulting general manager;
* **Brand manager** — the general manager at a company that mostly deals in selling;
* And more.

To get to the position of general manager, a company employee usually has to be experienced as a low-tier manager. In most cases, it’s managers of lower positions within the company itself that get the promotion and become general managers, though they can sometimes also be hired among external professionals.

General managers can also be promoted to higher executive positions or, alternatively, hired by bigger companies as well. In order to get a promotion, a general manager has to be extremely well acquainted with their departmental operations, highly experienced in employee management, good at budgeting, formulating strategies, and recognized for making the right decisions.  

#### What Does the General Manager Do

General managers are in charge of the company’s business as a whole — its financial aspects, day-to-day operations, administrative functioning, and more. This is a very significant and responsible position that often relies on delegating tasks.

The main responsibility of a general manager is to oversee the work of other managers below their rank. Such lower-rank managers are usually responsible for smaller sub-divisions of their departments and are always directly responsible to the general managers.

General managers supervise the managers of particular company departments and give out instructions to them. They oversee the hiring of managers as well as their training. They’re also in charge of making budgets for new hires, marketing resources, supplies, and equipment. In some cases, they directly communicate with employees to motivate them to work towards achieving the goals of the company.

General managers also work together with their superiors — executives and high-level managers — on a daily basis, to ensure overall company management runs smoothly. Their position is highly responsible, multi-faceted, and requires a lot of experience in the field they supervise.

#### General Manager vs. Operations Manager

As the managers in charge of company operations, general managers are often compared to (or, in some cases, even confused with) operations managers. While these are two separate positions, they are, in fact, similar. They’re both in charge of coming up with plans on how to make the company more efficient and profitable. Apart from that, they both communicate internally with multiple departments to ensure daily operations run smoothly, too. 

However, besides their similarities, these positions have a key difference that distinguishes them from one another. Namely, general managers are in charge of all aspects of the company’s business, whereas operations managers are only in charge of production and operations. This means that general managers have more responsibilities than operations managers since they’re also in charge of sales, marketing, HR, strategy making, and more.

#### Summary

A general manager (GM) is a manager that oversees the operations of a department or the whole company, particularly related to generating revenue and incurring costs. General managers are also in charge of most or all of the company’s sales and marketing efforts, as well.

In smaller companies, the highest executives usually fulfill the role of general managers. Larger, more hierarchical companies, on the other hand, commonly have general managers in their structure just below corporate-level executives but above other employees. 

Among C-Level executives, the CEO is considered the general manager of all other managers. Different business lines have their own general managers as well, ranked right below the CEO. These general managers for different business branches can include product managers (technology), branch managers (bank branches), managing directors (service providers), brand managers (sales-focused companies), and more.

General managers are commonly recruited among already employed lower-level managers, who need to achieve a higher level of experience in their business line to get the promotion. From there on, general managers can also be promoted to higher executive positions.

General managers directly supervise managers of particular departments who report directly to them. Overseeing the hiring and training of managers, making budgets for different purposes, and working with employees towards achieving the goals of the company are some of the other responsibilities that general managers assume.

General managers are sometimes confused with operations managers. While both of these are in charge of planning how to increase the company’s effectiveness and profitability, general managers have more responsibilities than operations managers.

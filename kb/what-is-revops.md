### Definition

Revenue Operations (REVOps), a **business function, aims to maximize an organization's revenue potential**. It enables full-funnel accountability by aligning Marketing Operations, Sales Operations, and Service Operations across the organization's process, platform, and employees.

REVOps can be a great tool for rewriting internal operations, improving client acquisition, empowering client delight, and creating a culture that drives revenue.

Imagine revenue as more than a result of a great product or service. Revenue is the result of your Marketing, Service, and Sales departments working together as one powerful growth team. Sales and Marketing are dead. Revenue Team FTW.

#### What is the purpose of REVops?

Revenue Operations was created so that business leaders can stop chasing revenue and instead start operating it across the company.

Organizations used to work in siloed teams with different missions, disconnected customer experiences, disjointed analytics, and had separate departments. The theory was that one hand didn’t know what the other was doing, and money was being left on their table.

REVOps was born out of a few core requirements:

* **Marketing Technology has become increasingly important** to the business landscape.
* The management **across Marketing ops, Sales ops, and Service needs to be more efficient** and unified.
* The **customer experience required more connectivity** as well as more personalization at scale.

These needs were created to address customer experience discontinuity, operational inefficiencies, lack of clarity about the bottlenecks, and revenue opportunities in the business.

### What tools should you use?

REVOps connects all three key teams (marketing teams, sales teams, and customer success teams); your CRM is the backbone of your revenue generation operations. It allows everyone to work with standard data fields, which is crucial for your improvement.

Operations teams should ensure that they regularly enter data and that they are aware of the importance of data entry. Once that's done, you can add more tools to your toolbox.

Forecasting tools allow you to spot trends in purchasing and make key business decisions about pricing, features, staffing, and other areas. Forecasting is a key function of leadership to help them create appropriate budgets and allocate resources.

Pipeline management tools are a hot topic. They make your life easier by allowing you to see where deals are at a glance and automating reminders and notifications. The best ones give a unified view of all revenue generation teams.

You can use enablement tools to determine if your content is effective. These tools will give you some serious scoring to show you what works and what doesn’t. These tools are the best way to get metrics about where the rubber meets the road in your sales funnel.

#### What problems can RevOps solve?

Forbes stated that REVops is an *"end-to-end process of driving revenue."* It starts with prospect consideration (marketing) and ends when you close the deal. This includes their renewal and upsells (Customer Success).

> *"This orchestration results in faster business growth and greater profit."*

#### Have you said any of these things lately?

***"Our method isn't working!"*** REVops creates processes for each stage of the customer journey to provide a consistent and enjoyable experience for prospects as they move through the customer journey.

***"Our tools and data are a mess!"*** REVops solves messy data and overlapping tools by activating one entity to oversee all data and tools used for tracking the flow of revenue through the company.

***"The team is disjointed. No one is working together."*** Disjointed teams can be a huge momentum killer, from poor MQLs to poor client onboarding experiences. REVops eliminates silos and infighting within departments by shifting the focus from individual departments to a collective perspective that considers the revenue flow across the company.

### The 3 Pillars Of REVops

RevOps was founded on three pillars: Team, Tools, and Tactics.

Each pillar is a foundational block upon which the next pillar will be built. Only by clearly defining each pillar can you create a framework that allows you to focus, clarify, and hold your organization accountable.

#### Team

Those responsible for managing and bringing together your processes and platforms. REVteam can either create a REVops team for a particular organization or transition the responsibility with your existing team.

#### Tools

Accurate information is key to success in every situation. Your technology must be connected and aligned within your organization to tell a clear story about your revenue pipeline. Individuals can see how they directly or indirectly impact the pipeline by providing one source of truth. We love HubSpot for connecting the Revenue Team.

#### Tactics

To foster a culture of collaboration, you need to ensure that you have the right processes to do so. REVops creates a culture of collaboration by implementing standard processes that foster accountability and trust within the organization.

You will see additional benefits as your operations teams work together in converting prospects into raving customers. This will include shorter sales cycles, better retention, and higher upsell volumes.

### How to implement Revenue Operations?

SiriusDecisions says that B2B organizations that implement aligned revenue operations will be the best placed to succeed in the next three to five years. Here are the steps you need to take to implement RevenueOps.

#### 1. Audit

The following steps will help you to audit your customer journey and identify areas of disconnect between departments:

* Analyze all your content and align it with the buyer's lifecycle stage. Create a plan to fill in any gaps
* To ensure that your technology is correctly tagging every move your potential buyer makes, audit your marketing operations, sales operations, and service departments.
* Audit your website and other digital footprints to ensure that you have all conversion best practices in place. This will ensure that your potential buyers are not denied entry.

#### 2. Define and Align

* Analyze your analytics to get a complete view of your revenue pipeline, and the health of your business.
* To identify redundancies in software and tools, audit your Tech Stack.
* Your team will benefit from REVops-based, streamlined processes for content marketing and customer delight.

#### 3. Build

To increase your revenue potential, you can restructure or build the following items:

* Create a Go to Market plan for customer acquisition and client delight.
* To ensure accurate data in your revenue engine, create workflows that move prospects through the system.
* Inbound sales follow-up emails and task lists should be created.
* Outbound sales outreach emails and task lists should be created.
* Create a REVops dashboard to show your current bottlenecks.

#### 4. Activate and Optimize

* To maintain alignment, conduct a REVops meeting with the Marketing, Sales, and Service department heads. This will help you set growth goals and ensure that they are fully aware of their role in the revenue-producing mission.
* To ensure that your REVops growth strategy is continued adoption and optimization, create and follow a 12-month rolling execution plan.
* The REVops Dashboard can be used to identify the lifecycle stage with the largest bottleneck each month. You can then activate predefined process playbooks to "unstick" the bottlenecks.

### Are you ready for REVops? Is your team ready?

REVops is more than an organizational structure or a new title in the C-suite. It is a way to create a collaborative culture that supports the four operational pillars. It is not enough to just name a chief revenue officer and expect organizational alignment.

Your operations teams must be prepared for big changes if you want to see success. Take a deep breath and answer the questions below--self-reflection is encouraged.

#### Transparency Throughout Departments

An industry-leading MarTech company's marketing team tried account-based marketing and knocked on sales' doors to get all their top accounts.

An AE was skeptical. "I didn’t trust marketing, they’d simply spam my accounts and burn every bridge," he said. "So I lied to them and gave them subpar ones." This is a tale as old and it's about poor communication and competing priorities that breed a culture of protectionism.

The REVops pillars strengthen each department and replace infighting with transparency. Instead of making uninformed decisions based upon misaligned data and making poor strategic decisions, the REVops team ensures that everyone has access to the truth.

This is how trust can be built and walls are broken for good.

#### Growth and Adaptability

Growth can be expected when your teams are aligned and optimized for revenue generation. Because the REVops team has a good grasp of your data, sustainable growth can be predicted well in advance. GTM teams can be prepared for any eventuality, whether it's a feast or famine.

Their process and systems are well-maintained. Executives have the data and recommendations to plan for the future and make long-term decisions. REVops could be a great way to help your teams adapt to market changes and launch new products.

### Summary

REVops tools are essential for businesses looking to improve their operations. These tools can help you streamline your workflow and optimize your processes.

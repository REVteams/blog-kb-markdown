# How to Sell into Enterprise?

## Selling a \$1million software contract to an organization is a different art than selling a $120 per year subscription to one person.

The Enterprise sales cycle lasts for months. It involves building relationships and customizing a solution to address their specific problems and requirements.

Although it is slower than selling a personal subscription at a lower price, the benefits can be enormous. Enterprise software sales agreements allow your company to lock down multiple-year contracts and generate more revenue.

### [What is enterprise sales?](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-enterprise) How do sales processes differ?

Enterprise sales is the sale of a high-value product to an organization. This often involves customized onboarding and customization. This is often a product or software-as-a-service (SaaS), a tool that an entire department, team, or organization will use.

Enterprise sales can take weeks or months and involve multiple decision-makers. This selling process is quite different from small business sales or B2C transactions. It can also be riskier because sales reps could spend weeks working on a deal with no reward.

Enterprise sales are very profitable - the deals are large and feel more secure with multi-year and annual contracts.

### Four Steps for Selling Software to Enterprise

To navigate the sales cycle more effectively, develop a well-thought-out sales strategy. 

#### 1. Find realistic buyers for your target pool

It's important to understand the basics of sales because they might spend weeks or even months on a sale. Your reps can be as efficient as possible by focusing on realistic buyers.

The "Enterprise personality" focuses on four key areas: Firmographics, demand drivers, technology environment, and the decision-making process.

**Firmographics** - basic information about an organization such as its size and industry. This is important as startups with investors may view purchase decisions differently than public companies.

**Demand Drivers** are what is driving the software change, such as shifting regulations or competing pressures.

**Technology Environment** gives an overview of the current technology landscape including preferred vendors and legacy technology.

**Decision Process** shows who the decision-makers in an organization are and whether they need to be vetted by multiple people before it is given the green light.

These details will help you pinpoint your sales efforts. You can match your prospecting list with this buyer persona to identify your ideal customers.

Next, you will need to research the buying needs and processes of enterprise buyers. You should gather as much information about the following as possible:

**The prospect's drive.** How can your software help them achieve their technology goals? Are the prospects driven by business goals or a desire for a better tech stack?

**Their buying cycle.** Are they ready to purchase now? What is the average time it takes for a company to make a purchase decision? How do they budget for and plan for new software?

**Their motivation.** What motivates them to purchase your product? What is their need for new technology? Are they using outdated software? What will your product do for them?

These questions will give you a good idea of what a realistic enterprise customer looks and feels like.

Prospects may feel pressure to keep up with their competitors and update their tech stack. It could be that they are looking to win new business opportunities. It is important to identify the driving force behind your target's buying decisions for both marketing and sales purposes.

#### 2. Make sure you target the decision-maker

Reach out to more than one person at the company that you are interested in. It's a good idea to target decision-makers early in your selling process. This will save you time talking with gatekeepers and other people who don't have control over the company's software and tools.

This can be achieved by using the MEDDIC lead qualification method. This methodology encourages sales reps and other professionals to approach prospects directly and ask qualifying questions such as:

*"How does your company typically make buying decisions?"*
*"Is there anyone else involved with the buying process?"*
*"What is your role in the decision-making process?"*

These questions will help you determine if you're talking to the right person, or if you should escalate the conversation to a decision-maker.

Once you have established a conversation with the decision-maker, it is time to guide them on the customer journey that will convince them to invest in your software.

#### 3. Get to the top of your enterprise customer journey

Because enterprise software is often a large investment, it can be more difficult to close deals with enterprise customers than with other customers. Software changes can be costly in terms of time and money. Change management professionals are available to help with tech adoption.

You must convince the decision-maker to sign the deal.

Roman Stanek, founder and CEO of GoodData, explained the following:

> *"If you want your technology to be sold to an enterprise, you must solve real problems for it, and you should expect to have a substantial marketing and sales operation.<br><br>Fundamentally, the product must make work easier, integrate with other systems better, and meet more stringent requirements than a consumer item. Although the enterprise is large and slow-moving, it is a powerful and valuable animal. It is necessary to address its concerns and its personality before you can capture it."*

What does it take to address the concerns of enterprise prospects?

First, present a value proposition to them that can be used to benefit their company. A meaningful conversation with enterprise prospects hinges on understanding what your product does and how it will benefit their daily work life.

After you have communicated the value of your product, focus on these three things:

1. Give examples of value-added scenarios. Show the prospect how your product has helped other customers and how it will help them achieve their goals. Show them real-life examples of how your software helped a customer grow or solved a problem.
2. Demonstrate that your software is suitable for enterprise use. Enterprise companies are always looking for ways to grow and scale. Your prospect should know that their enterprise software can grow with their existing tech stack and that it is reliable and secure enough to handle enterprise-level demands (such as large volumes of data or multi-national data sets).
3. Play the long game when it comes to enterprise deals -- they don't close overnight. Don't try to force them to close prematurely. You'll lose your prospect.

The sales cycle at the enterprise level can be long and drawn out, so it's important to be comfortable with that and to schedule regular follow-ups. However, you don't want to be too frequent or you'll annoy potential buyers.

The final step in closing the deal is when your prospect is ready for the plunge and is ready to buy your product.

#### 4. Close the deal

Closing an enterprise sale of software requires more than signing a contract or releasing login details.

It is crucial that all new enterprise customers feel supported during the onboarding phase and the deployment phase. It can take several weeks for enterprise software to be implemented, so your company must support the customer at every step.

Your work is not done when the contract with your new customer is signed. Enterprise customers pay top dollar to have customized products and experiences. During the closing phase of a deal, this value must be delivered.

### Sales Strategies for Enterprise Deals

#### SPIN Selling

SPIN selling is where sales reps establish a relationship with prospects to tailor a solution that suits their problem.

The methodology is based on a four-part questioning framework.

**Situation.** Asking prospects about their processes, tools, objectives, and responsibilities so that sales reps can learn more about their goals.

**Problem.** Asking about prospects' challenges to create a solution that meets their individual needs.

**Implication.** Asking questions about the problems that were identified in the previous step to help them understand how they affect their company. These questions help to reduce the problem's size and increase urgency in solving it.

**Need.** Asking about solutions your prospect has found and introduce your enterprise software solution.

Sales reps should use "SPIN" questions to guide prospects through the sales funnel, instead of following a strict script. This is a good strategy for individual enterprise prospects.

#### Challenger Selling

The Challenger sales model focuses on the prospect's individual needs and allows them to take control of the sales experience.

This allows sales reps to deliberately challenge their prospect's thinking and forces them into a new perspective. The prospect will be open to a casual discussion with the sales rep if they create tension.

Once an alternative solution has been found, sales reps can present their company's enterprise-level software to solve the prospect’s problem.

#### Consultative Selling

Consultative selling refers to when sales reps place the customer relationship above their desire for a sale or promotion of a product.

Although it may seem counterproductive, poor customer relationships are one of the main reasons for churn. If companies only focus on closing sales and not solving prospects' problems, they are at risk of falling into this category.

Consultative selling is about understanding your prospect's needs and identifying their biggest pain points before offering a product or solution.

Building trust with customers is key to closing deals and winning repeat business. This can take some extra time than other sales methods, but it will help you close more deals.

Consultative selling is different from other sales strategies. It encourages enterprise customers not to focus on the product's price but instead on its value.

These are the differences between product-based and consultative selling.

### Overall Enterprise Sales Cycle Structure

#### 1. Discovery

The enterprise sales cycle usually begins with you getting to know the needs and interests of potential customers through preliminary conversations and research. To gauge the viability of a deal and uncover potential pain points, ask thoughtful questions.

These questions can be related to elements such as organizational missions, larger company goals, prior purchases, timelines, and potential roadblocks.

This information will help you to create a targeted, effective sales strategy that your prospect is likely to be open to. This helps you to eliminate deals that are unlikely to succeed. It's crucial to be able to manage your time and effort well during the enterprise sales cycle.

#### 2. Diagnosis

Discovering your prospects' business is only half of understanding them in an enterprise sales cycle. The enterprise sales teams must know their prospects inside and out if they want to maintain a productive relationship throughout the six-plus month enterprise sales cycle.

It is up to you to identify and solve their problems, even if they haven't thought of them. Do your research on their industry.

Look closely at the ways they use your product or service in relation to businesses of similar size or nature.

Find out what your prospects are struggling with, both now and in the future, and then translate that information into solutions. You can then begin to build a picture of your prospects' business and how you can help them.

#### 3. Design

Once you have a clear understanding of *the* issues your prospects are facing, you can begin to create a plan for *how* they can be helped. This stage requires some collaboration with your prospects.

The goal is to find a solution that meets their specific needs. It is up to both parties to create a functional, well-tailored solution.

You have the responsibility to make it happen. However, open communication is essential. Educate your prospect continuously throughout the process and discuss problems and solutions as they arise.

This step underscores the importance of relationship-building in the enterprise sales process. A significant *personal* investment is required to create a *customized* solution. You should have worked closely with your prospects up to this point to be able to create a thoughtful, specific, and effective proposal that will address their needs.

#### 4. Delivery

After your proposal has been accepted, this part of the enterprise sales process takes place. You must implement the personalized solution that you have created. This means creating and executing a realistic, customized implementation plan that works both for you and your customer.

It is also important to have a clear idea of how you will measure the success of your solution. You need to establish the metrics you'll use and report on your product's performance to determine if it is working for your customer.

Once you have all the necessary information, it is time to establish a productive, active relationship with your customer.

### Do you know your prospect enough?

It's not because comedians aren't doing enough research on their audiences, but they know their audience well.

They spend months practicing their jokes on smaller stages and learning what works. They can confidently walk on stage when the Madison Square Garden special set happens.

This is exactly what it takes to win enterprise sales.

After we have gotten our heads around the commitment that enterprise selling requires, enterprise sales reps need to get to know the buyers and what they need.

**1. Calculate your total addressable market.**

This is an extremely important topic and warrants its own article. 

**2. Choose the accounts that you feel are the best to start with.**

In enterprise sales, the power of the pipeline is unrivalled. This is a long game. Make sure you prioritize your time with accounts that are best suited from the beginning. 

**3. Go inside their world**

Once you have a prioritized list of key targets, set up alerts for industry and company news. Acquisitions, announcements and changes, new business, among others. Things you should be looking for are:

* What's the market doing?
* What are their challenges?
* What do Crunchbase, Pitchbook, and their annual reports have to say about them?
* What is there internal motivation, what do they want at work? Is it a promotion, recognition, etc. Figure it out. 
* What is their roadmap?

**4. Find common ground and map the organization**

Identify the people you believe will be involved in the purchase process. Who will be your buyer? Who will be inner circle champion?

Engage with them. Make sure you add value to the conversation and stand out. 

### Summary

The enterprise sales process can be daunting, but by following the tips in this guide, you can make it simpler and more efficient. By streamlining your efforts, you'll be able to focus on what's important – making a sale.

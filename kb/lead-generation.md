# Lead Generation

## For every business to be able to sell products or services and generate revenue, it needs to find buyers. With that in mind, businesses rarely ever start off with an established base of buyers ready to purchase from them. 

Instead, they often have to make efforts to gain a presence in their desired markets. Even after they acquire a certain number of customers and [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client), they’ll want to keep getting more and more in order to maintain their profitability. One of the main processes businesses go through to [acquire new customers](https://www.demandjump.com/blog/what-is-customer-acquisition) is known as lead generation.

#### Definition

In marketing terminology, the term lead generation is used to describe the process of businesses trying to make their target audiences interested in the products and/or services they’re selling. This is done with the aim of getting contact information from these audiences (referred to as leads) and eventually [converting](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) them into paying customers. 

#### Why Is Lead Generation Important

Through lead generation, a business educates its target audience — that is, the potential buyers of its products and/or services — of the value that its solutions can bring them. After this process finally turns them into qualified leads, sales professionals working for the business can reach out to them in an attempt to convert them into paying customers. 

One of the fields where lead generation plays an important role is in [e-commerce](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-e-commerce). This is because lead generation is most effective when done online, especially through e-mail marketing. Through this practice, businesses can gather their target audiences’ contact information (e-mails, social media profiles, phone numbers, and more) and use it for their marketing campaigns, promoting their products and services to these audiences. Even if a lead isn’t ready to purchase an item yet, they’ll keep getting reminders of product and/or service promotions, discounts, and other benefits that businesses offer them through these contact channels, before they finally get an offer that suits them well and eventually convert into a paying customer.

[B2B](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2b) businesses also heavily rely on generating leads. These businesses focus on selling to other businesses, usually in bulk, which means making even a single purchase from them can be pretty expensive, costing buyers thousands of dollars. This factor greatly diminishes the likelihood of a random visitor purchasing products or services from the website of a B2B business Because of this, B2B businesses have to focus on generating leads to convert into customers more than their [B2C](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2c) counterparts, for instance.

#### Online Lead Generation

Nowadays, a larger part of lead generation is done online, through internet marketing. Here, the process of getting an internet user’s contact information — that is, getting a lead — is commonly done through web forms.

For businesses with websites, online lead generation generally consists of two processes: attracting visitors to their websites and encouraging them to share contact information.

The first process implies that businesses should figure out how to get their potential buyers — or target audience members in general — to land upon their web pages while browsing the internet. Businesses can generate site traffic from their target audiences by using different tools and practices depending on their nature and financial capabilities. Some of these tools include:

* **Search engine optimization (SEO)** — Through [SEO](https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo), businesses optimize their websites to the algorithms of search engines such as Google, which generate the largest amounts of traffic on the internet. The aim of this process is to have the business’s websites show up higher in the organic results when an internet user browse search engines, which makes it more likely for them to get visitors.  
* **Search engine marketing (SEM)** — [SEM](https://www.wordstream.com/search-engine-marketing) is similar to SEO in that it consists of businesses using search engines to reach out to their target audiences. The difference is that, rather than optimizing their websites for organic outreach, SEM implies paying search engines for them to display the business’s advertisements in internet users’ search results, usually leading to the business’s websites. 
* **Website ads** — Apart from promoting themselves through search engines, businesses can also contact other site owners and pay them to display ads leading to their own websites.
* **Social media presence** — Internet users spend increasing amounts of their time on various different social media sites which generate almost as much traffic as search engines. Here, businesses can engage internet users through the content they create on their social media profiles, as well as pay for ads and promotions on the platforms. 
* And more.

After businesses manage to attract visitors to their websites, they need to proceed by turning these visitors into leads — that is, getting their contact information for a start. This process usually starts by getting visitors interested in the products or services that businesses offer, which leads up to them filling a web form with their contact information — usually their e-mails but also other contact channels such as phone numbers and so on.

To get website visitors to leave their contact information on sites, among other things, businesses can use some of the following marketing approaches:

* Giving visitors access to exclusive, high-level content in exchange for their contact information. This can include exclusive product or service-related videos, additional tools to work with, written materials related to the solutions the businesses offer, and so on.
* Organizing webinars or other forms of video meetings, where participants are invited to share their contact information before they join.
* Optimizing their websites (landing and sales pages) to show visitors how the products and/or services they offer are the ideal solutions for them. In this way, visitors will be organically driven to share their contact information because they’ll want to know more, which will in itself convert them into leads.
* And more.

Having gathered the contact info of their recently generated leads, businesses can proceed with the processes of nurturing them, qualifying them, and eventually having their sales professionals convert the most qualified among these leads into paying customers.

#### Summary

Lead generation is the process of businesses raising the interest of their target audiences in the products and/or services they’re selling, having a primary aim to get the contact information of these audiences. The aim of this process is to eventually convert these audiences into paying customers.

Businesses generate leads because it helps them educate their potential customers about the solutions they’re offering and how they can help them. The process of lead generation ultimately results in businesses acquiring qualified leads, which their sales teams can then work on to have them make a purchase.

B2B is another field where lead generation plays a significant role — businesses selling to other businesses often offer bulk and expensive items that random site visitors are unlikely to buy, and therefore these businesses rely heavily on generating leads themselves.

The practice of online lead generation (which is how generating leads is mostly done nowadays) generally consists of two processes: attracting visitors to the businesses’ websites, and encouraging them to share their contact information with these businesses.

To attract website visitors, businesses can use a number of different tools, including search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), website ads, social media promotions, and more. From here on, businesses can get visitors to share their contact information with them, usually by using a web form. They can achieve this by using strategies such as offering visitors exclusive content in exchange for their contacts, having them participate in webinars where they have to share contact info beforehand, optimizing their sites’ landing and sales pages to promote their solution, and incite organic interest in them.

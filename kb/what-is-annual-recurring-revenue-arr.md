# What is Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

## The term revenue, used in business and accounting, designates a company’s income in terms of the increase of its net assets as a result of its regular business activities — mostly through sales.

In business, a company’s revenue can be classified as transaction-based, project, service, or recurring revenue. When it comes to recurring revenue, it can further be divided by how often it is tracked, usually as either **monthly recurring revenue** or as **annual recurring revenue**.

### Definition

Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, designates a company’s recurring revenue — that is, incomes that it anticipates will occur on a regular periodic basis throughout a larger time period — measured annually.

ARR is a metric of the [subscription economy](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042715/how-do-subscription-business-models-work.asp), which revolves around the idea of selling products and services to customers continuously, in regular time intervals (usually every month or year) to generate recurring revenue. This approach of continuous instead of one-time sales focuses more on retaining a company’s existing company, and less on attracting new ones.

### When Should Companies Calculate ARR

ARR should be calculated when a company expects to receive recurring revenue from specific client subscriptions on a yearly basis, for a minimum of one year.

When dealing with more short-term subscriptions, calculating them as ARR would not be very accurate. Shorter subscriptions that last for less than a year usually allow such terms as 30-day cancellation notice periods for clients, which makes them a bad choice to include in ARR calculations as companies can’t be sure that these will provide recurring revenue on a yearly basis. In such cases, it’s better to record them as monthly recurring revenue (MRR) rather than ARR.

### How Can ARR Be Used

For companies, ARR is an indispensable metric when dealing with yearly subscriptions. Some of the many uses companies will find for ARR include:

* **Determining whether the subscription model works for them** — ARR is used for measuring subscription revenue in particular. As such, it gives companies a clear insight into how well they can implement the subscription business model, and whether it suits them best.
* **Measuring company health** — Any company that bases most of its revenue on yearly subscription deals can use ARR to measure how well it’s doing. ARR helps them figure out how successful they’ve been in each particular area of their business, as it helps them see in which of these areas they’ve been gaining revenue, and in which ones they’ve been losing revenue. This makes it easier for these companies to plan their future steps in relation to employing new candidates, setting salaries, internal finances, and business operations.
* **Generating more revenue** — With ARR, companies monitor changes in customer dealings, which can give them an idea of their needs and behaviors. This can help them increase their [cross-sales and up-sales](https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-difference-between-upselling-and-cross-selling/), which in turn translates to increased revenue.
* **Predicting future revenues** — The ARR metric allows companies to put the timeframes and costs of each subscription into perspective. This, in turn, helps them predict revenue that they’d get from new clients, and improve their expense management as well.
* **Keeping the employees that contribute the most** — Measuring ARR can provide an insight into a company’s biggest successes when it comes to sales, and in which particular sector they’ve been achieved. With this in mind, companies can easily determine which employees turn in the biggest revenue and in which sectors. Focusing on keeping and promoting the most productive employees can slash new employee recruitment costs.
* **Bringing in investors** — Subscription-based businesses that come up with solid ARR estimates are the kind people want to invest in. Investors will often choose the security and predictability of a regular-income company with subscription deals over any other that bases most of its economic activity on one-time sales.
* **Putting growth into perspective** — A company’s ARR reflects its predictions of the amount of revenue it will keep getting, and this allows it to determine at what rate it can expand in the future. Companies that compare their ARR over the years can come up with a very accurate evaluation of their past policies, which can help them project future growth more easily.

### How to Calculate ARR

To start calculating ARR, companies have to separate their recurring revenue from other income, such as one-time payments they may receive and other variable fees they may be charging.

A company’s annual subscription income from a single customer can be taken as a simple example of how to calculate ARR. In such a case, the company can determine its ARR by dividing the total amount received by the number of years the subscription lasts.

For example, let’s say that a customer is paying for a 4-year subscription, and the total amount he pays the company for the whole 4-year period is $20,000. The equation is as follows:

**\$20,000/4=$5,000**

So, in this particular case with this single customer, the company expects an ARR of $5,000.

To do the calculation with multiple customers, the company should apply the same equation to each one of them. Then, it should calculate the sum of all the results to determine the ARR from these customers.

For example, if the company has 3 customers, and the annual revenue is \$5,000 from the first customer, \$4,000 from the second one, and $1,000 from the third one, the company should do the following equation:

**\$5,000+\$4,000+\$1,000=$10,000**

In this case, then, for the company that has 3 customers, $10,000 would be its total ARR.

In practice, though, companies usually focus on calculating several individual ARRs more than they focus on the total ARR. However, in real life, companies prefer breaking down the total figure into some individual ARRs. These specific ARRs commonly include:

* New customer ARRs;
* ARRs that show renewals made by existing customers;
* ARRs that show upgrades made by existing customers.

Apart from the above individual ARRs, companies also like to measure the ones they’ve lost, such as:

* Lost ARRs from customers that stopped using the company’s products/services;
* Lost ARRs from subscription downgrades made by existing customers.

In this way, by dividing their ARRs into smaller bits, companies can determine what kind of customers are most likely to increase or decrease their ARR.

### Summary

Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is an important metric for companies that use the subscription-based business model. With it, these companies project the yearly revenue they expect to get on a regular basis.

The ARR calculation is most suitable for companies that have long-term contracts with their clients, lasting for a minimum of one year.

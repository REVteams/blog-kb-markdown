This is especially so if their relationship with these clients is continuous and they consider them important to the overall success of their business.

For the purpose of maintaining good client relations and keeping the sales process going, some companies have developed specialized positions. One good example of such a position is the account development representative or ADR.

### Definition

Account development representatives are tasked with maintaining the company’s relationship with their long-standing and most important clients. Businesses often refer to such strategic clients as their [accounts](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-account) — hence the name, account development representatives.

### Requirements

People with experience in sales departments usually apply for ADR positions. Apart from sales representatives, anyone with some experience as a customer service agent or account executive can apply and be accepted for an ADR post. 

When it comes to education, higher education and master’s degrees in business-related fields are highly recommended. [Salaries](https://www.salary.com/research/salary/listing/account-development-representative-salary) for account development representatives positions are more than competitive, so education and experience are highly valued when companies hire for ADR positions.

### What Does an ADR Do? 

An ADR is in charge of taking care of current client relationships, as well as creating new ones, by using strategic approaches and implementing best market practices. 

Together with the project management team, ADRs can also work to come up with the best ways to promote the company in public. They can even be assigned customer service related tasks by some companies.

Depending on the industries they work in, account development representatives will typically be charged with multiple — if not all — of the following tasks:

* Managing tactical implementations such as creative and technical development, measurement, reporting, and improving ROI.
* Showing the company’s ROI by using online business solutions.
* Making payroll and pre-billing reports.
* Discussing and working on marketing programs with clients.
* Interviewing new job candidates.
* Training new ADR's and teaching them to fit in with the work environment.
* Creating necessary information in the company’s information-tracking tools.
* Working with information in the company’s customer relationship management tools.
* Creating and executing plans for covering particular geographical areas in the name of the company, as well as conducting research and workshops in said areas.
* Treating equipment-related issues.
* Targeting a business’ persons of interest and essential stakeholders.
* Expanding the company’s client network.
* Maintaining recently acquired business contacts through meetings and communication.
* Focusing on the clients that the company deems very important in order to assure their loyalty.
* Designating funds and deadlines for projects.
* Finding the best software and programs to help the company maintain a good level of communication with its clients.
* Creating more sales leads.
* Making an account management strategy to help the company manage its operations with its clients, helping it create a workflow plan, set its objectives related to their relationship to each client, working on achieving said objectives, and tracking the company’s progress in fulfilling these tasks.
* And more.

Keeping up good company relationships with the most important clients can be a challenging goal. This is why account development representatives often find themselves with many tasks and assignments.

### Skills

As the position of ADR carries multiple responsibilities, it also requires a certain set of skills. These include quite a bit of soft and hard skills, such as:

* **Being able to communicate and negotiate** — Every ADR should be an expert at communicating with clients, whether it’s done in person, on the phone, through email, by using social media communication, or in any other way, individually and in groups. Most often than not, ADRs communicate with all branches of a business when trying to make sure that the client is satisfied, so communication skills are simply a must. ADRs should also be excellent negotiators, as they will likely have to broker deals with clients and attempt to satisfy each party in the process. 
* **Knowing clients and understanding how to help them out** — Successful ADRs maintain strong connections with the company’s most valued clients. They know everything about the company they work for and have significant insight into the businesses of its clients as well. In this way, ADRs can identify the most effective strategies to help their clients grow, and provide them with all the concrete solutions they need, adapted to their specific needs and circumstances.
* **Long-term planning** — Another crucial skill ADRs must have is to be able to look at things from the perspective of what is sustainable to the company’s client relationship in the long-term, rather than just focusing on short-term gains for it. This means they should always try to come up with the right deals that will enhance the company’s client relationships and help them build a bond that will stand the test of time. Often times this can even mean sacrificing some of the company’s short-term monetary gains in order to come up with a deal that’s more convenient for their clients.
* **Focusing on providing value** — Client relationships often revolve around being able to close good deals with them, but in order to create lasting bonds, clients should know they’re getting a good value out of it. ADR’s should strive for this in their dealings with clients, and always put the value that the company provides at the forefront of every client interaction. Little things such as attention to detail and personalizing offers can go a long way towards showing the clients they’re getting the best possible deal. 
* **Management and leadership skills** — It should go without saying that ADRs, as employees in charge of maintaining a constant level of exchange between the company and their clients, should always be ready to take the initiative. This means they should be confident, open-minded, and always be there to take the lead when the clients find themselves in a situation that requires guidance. The same goes when dealing with company staff. 
* **Experience with using the right tools** — like with any other job, there’s a set of utilities that can help ADRs in their work. These can include various tools in terms of software (notably [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) as the most common customer relationship management platform).   Some practical knowledge and experience in various related fields, such as account management, working with statistics, and customer care, are also among the qualities of good ADRs.

### Summary

Account development representatives, or ADRs, are in charge of a company’s client relationships. ADRs are charged with many client-related tasks within the company, each requiring dedication and a specific set of skills. Good ADRs know how to take initiative, communicate and negotiate, familiarize themselves with the company’s clients, build a long-term bond with them, and show them the value of their relationship.

People with experience in customer care, sales, and account management are good candidates for becoming ADRs. Successful ADRs don’t simply provide more sales for their company — they also create and maintain a wide yet compact network of business contacts, creating client relationships based on mutual respect and partnerships that stand the test of time.

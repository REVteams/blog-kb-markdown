# Split Testing - A/B Testing

A/B Testing

In an increasingly competitive market, businesses are constantly trying to optimize their marketing campaign or digital project to boost revenue. The best way to do so is to obtain data directly from customers or users.

A/B testing is one of the most effective research techniques that marketers and companies can use to obtain such data.

## A/B Testing Definition

**A/B testing**, also known as **split testing**, is an experiment that involves showing two versions of the same piece, such as a website, marketing email, ad, mobile app, or any other marketing asset to different users simultaneously.

This kind of testing is an established practice for measuring and comparing market responses. It eliminates guesswork and hunches from website optimization and allows for data-based decisions.

## Overview

The A/B testing experiment relies on a statistical analysis of the gathered data.

Typically, there is the current version, or version A (‘ the control’) and the modified version, or version B (’the treatment’) - hence the name A/B testing. These are shown to different users at the same time to determine which version performs better. By doing so, marketers can compare which version generates more traffic or drives more conversion.

This kind of testing goes back to the early 1920s when statistician Ronald Fisher mapped out the underlying principles of the A/B testing experiment. In fact, A/B testing was used even before Fisher, but he was the one who discovered and published the principles behind it in two groundbreaking books, **Statistical Methods for Research Workers** and **The Design of Experiments.**

Marketers applied these principles in their campaigns even in the 1960s and 1970s, to assess, for instance, whether a postcard or a letter would lead to more sales. But it was in the 1990s that this concept picked up and became ubiquitous in the digital realm. Today, big companies like Google or Facebook do [more than 10 000 A/B tests](https://learn.g2.com/ab-testing-statistics) per year.

## Why A/B Testing Is Important

Once a company has created some kind of a marketing asset, such as a website, an ad campaign, app, etc., they would want to know what works and what doesn’t. The following are some ways in which companies derive benefits from A/B testing.

### Improved Content Engagement

Users tend to click on ads or read content that is appealing to them. Every time a company does A/B testing and implements the results in future content, they are optimizing their content. This in turn leads to the target audience engaging more with a given company’s ads, pages, and emails.

### Reduced Bounce Rate

The [bounce rate](https://yoast.com/understanding-bounce-rate-google-analytics/) refers to the percentage of visitors that come to a given site and then leave (or “bounce”) without doing anything, instead of continuing to browse through other pages of the site or making a purchase.

A/B testing is a method that marketers can use to discover the exact reason for a high bounce rate.

### Increased ROI

Even a minor change can sometimes boost conversion rates, which in turn increases your ROI. A/B testing is therefore the easiest way to convert visits into purchases or sign-ups and increase profits.

A case in point is an A/B test that the company Viadeo performed on their homepage. Viadeo’s call-to-action (CTA), i.e. the prompt that encourages a user to take some action, said: **Sign up Now!** The A/B test revealed that simply adding the small phrase **It’s free!** right next to **Sign up Now!**, managed to [increase conversions by 28%](https://vwo.com/success-stories/viadeo/).

### Decreased Risk

When it comes to making major decisions about pricing or strategy, any company would want to base them on solid evidence to minimize the possibility of risk. A/B testing does precisely that, as it allows to test out the visitors’ responses before making these decisions.

## How Does A/B Testing Work?

To do A/B testing, a marketer will need to divide the process into several stages:

* **research;**
* **hypotheses;**
* **variation;**
* **testing;**
* **analysis.**

Let’s take a brief look into each of the stages.

### Research Stage

The first step is doing research, which involves gathering data.

For example, if a company is doing the test on their website, they will collect data on how the website is performing at the moment, including how many visitors it has, what are the conversion goals for specific pages, what pages visitors spend the most time on, etc.

A/B testing tools such as [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com) are useful here. Also, qualitative tools can be beneficial as well, such as [website user surveys](https://survicate.com/website-survey/experience-survey/), as they can reveal information that is not so easy to discover in quantitative data.

If a business is testing their Facebook ads, they may well decide to use the [Facebook ads manager.](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager) So the exact software a business uses will also depend on what they are testing.

### Hypotheses Stage

After collecting data, the marketer has to examine it and try to understand it.

The main goal of doing this is to formulate a hypothesis based on the data. A hypothesis, in this case, is an idea of what changes should be done to improve the marketing asset.

If there are several ideas, it’s best to prioritize them. Questions to keep in mind are:

* What is the desired impact?
* If the test is on a webpage, how important is the traffic on the given page?
* How easy would it be to implement these ideas?

### Variation Stage

Once the marketer has formulated a hypothesis, they need to make a variation (or several variations) based on it and compare it against the current (control) version. Simply put, a variation is a different control version that contains the changes the marketer wishes to test.

The variation can be something as simple as changing the color of a button. Below we will discuss in more detail what you can do A/B testing on.

### Testing Stage

At this stage, the visitors will be divided into equal segments and will be randomly exposed to either the control version or the variation while the test is running.

The [A/B testing software](https://www.trustradius.com/ab-testing) will help monitor and measure users’ responses to the different versions. Then, it will compare how each one performs.

### Analysis Stage

Finally, this is the point where the software will analyze and present the results. It will show the difference between the performance of the control version and the other variation. Most importantly, it will determine whether this difference is [statistically significant](https://www.convertize.com/ab-test-significance/) — if it is, it means that it is not due to chance or a random error.

The selected A/B testing software will then declare which version is the winner. Even if the preferred variation didn’t win or if there weren’t any results, a business can still benefit from the experience, as it can help them learn and test out other hypotheses they may have.

## What Can A/B Testing Be Used For?

Almost any element on a given marketing asset can be A/B tested. But as explained in the previous section, it is imperative to start the process by analyzing which assets would benefit from optimization through A/B testing the most.

Below, we will look into some examples, but note that the list is far from exhaustive.

### Website Elements

#### Titles & Copywriting

The first thing that visitors see when they come to a website is the headline. If it’s not attention-grabbing, they’ll simply leave. So it should go without saying that testing the titles and subtitles is a must. A marketer may also consider playing with different titles to see which ones are most appealing to visitors.

Other aspects of copywriting are equally important, such as the copy in the paragraphs (for example, testing different paragraph lengths is advisable), style (checking if the audience prefers easy-to-digest or perhaps more in-depth content), etc.

#### Images & Video Files

It’s also important to A/B test images and videos. Here, for example, businesses may attempt to determine what type of response some images generate versus others.

It is also useful to assess whether using pure text is better than combining visual elements and text. To cite one example, [an A/B test](https://sleeknote.com/blog/a-b-testing-examples#use-pure-text-vs-images-and-text-in-a-popup) run by the company Løbeshop showed that simply adding an image can lead to more conversions!

In terms of videos, companies may check if video files are more effective for generating traffic compared to images and text-only, what titles and video lengths are the most effective, etc.

#### CTAs

An A/B test conducted by the company [Black and Decker](https://blog.optimizely.com/2014/07/03/black-decker-discovers-big-win-in-buy-now-vs-shop-now-test/) illustrates just how important CTAs are. They tested out a seemingly insignificant modification, changing a CTA from **Buy Now** to **Shop Now**. As it turned out, this minor change made a big difference. The variation received a total of 17% fewer clicks, so of course, the company decided to keep the original CTA.

#### Forms

Other important aspects that can be optimized via A/B testing are web forms or online pages that allow user input and through which visitors can contact the company.

Here, your A/B tests can answer some of the following questions for the company:

* Is your web form too long?
* Does it contain too many questions?
* Are the questions too vague?

As there is no **perfect** form length, it is best to try out different versions and test what the specific audience might prefer.

When it comes to A/B testing forms, companies should especially be on the lookout for so-called **field bottlenecks** — that is, the fields that prevent users from completing the form. These can be things like personal information being required (ex. phone numbers or emails) and such. Once identified, the problematic fields should be removed to see if there are any changes.

### Marketing Campaign Elements

Similar to websites, in marketing campaigns, a marketer would also perform A/B tests on elements like CTA, visuals like images and videos, etc. Additionally, the following points are also inspected.

#### Email Subject Lines

In an email marketing campaign, the subject line of the email is arguably the most important thing for a marketer to keep in mind. This is because a boring subject line would automatically mean that the targeted audience would not even bother opening the email in the first place, which results in low click-through rates.

A/B testing email subject lines include elements like length or word order. For instance, if the subject line says “**Get 30% off for your next purchase by buying now**”, that could be more powerful than “**Buy now and get 30% off for your next purchase**” simply because the first version puts more focus on the benefit the customer will have from opening the email.

#### Email Personalization

Another important element in an email marketing campaign to consider in A/B testing is the level of personalization. For instance, in version A, the company could try addressing their customer as **Mr. Johnson**, and in version B, they could simply address them as **Nick** to evaluate if there is any difference.

Emails can be further personalized based on the customer’s past purchases, the types of products they have shown interest in, the types of products they searched for online, etc.

#### Time

The time of sending an email can also have an impact on the customer’s decision to open the email. For example, would a customer be more inclined to open an email they receive at 7 pm or one they receive at 10 am?

The same principle can be applied to the time of the day when ads are displayed. It is important to analyze during what part of the day the target audience has more time and is thus more likely to engage with an ad.

#### Ad Headline/Copy

If the marketing campaign consists of ads, it is vital to test the ad headline. Together with the visuals, the headline is among the most eye-catching and crucial elements in an ad.

Moreover, the ad copy could also make a big difference in conversion rates. For example, [an A/B test](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/09/25/a-b-testing) tested two versions of an ad copy, one addressing the customer with the greeting **Dear friend**, and another version without it. The version that didn’t have this greeting performed better, with a conversion rate that was 28.2% higher.

#### Channel

It also makes sense to test the channel where the ads are displayed. Since the target audience is likely to differ depending on the channel, an ad’s headline that might have a good response on Facebook could perform poorly on Linkedin.

## Summary

This article provided a brief overview of what A/B testing is, how it works, and what some of its benefits are. It also looked into some elements of websites or marketing assets this technique can be used for.

A/B testing is not simply a way to increase profits, but a way to make sound decisions in marketing that are backed by data.

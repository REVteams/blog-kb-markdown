People can be funny about money. This is also true for a business. You might think they don't like talking about money or they are afraid to share their budget with others because they consider it to be "sensitive information."

The money conversation is essential when it comes down to business.

It is crucial to understand the budget of potential clients and therefore you need to know how to ask about budget sales from them. This will help you build your solution. It helps you set expectations for your prospect and determine whether the project will generate profit.

### Definition

A sales budget is an itemized plan which predicts your total revenue. It takes into account the number of units that you expect to sell and the price at which you intend to sell them. It is used to establish a baseline for how much money you can expect to make in a given period.

This will help guide financial forecasting and goal setting.

[Sales forecasts](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-forecasting) and sales budgets are often confused. This is a common mistake. Both are similar in that they offer some form of forecasting of sales figures for some time, but they differ in their intent and timeframe.

A sales budget is a guideline for your company's future. It gives you a baseline understanding of the expectations of your Revenue team. A sales forecast is often an extension of that. Forecasts use that information to predict how *likely* your company will live up to those expectations.

Sales forecasts are also more flexible and cover shorter periods. They usually make predictions on a weekly basis, monthly basis, or quarterly. Sales budgets, however, account for an entire calendar year.

#### Ask your prospect about their budget.

It is essential to know your prospect's budget before any project can move forward. The budget will determine whether your prospect is a good financial fit, define the scope of the project, and help **avoid scope creep**. It will save you both time and money, position you professionally, and help you gain the confidence of your potential client.

You might be reluctant to discuss numbers with prospects. Therefore, you need to explain to them that a budget plan will help them.

If you are looking to buy a car, you probably have a budget in mind. Your budget will allow you to find the right car faster than if they show you every vehicle on the lot, from 2001 Hondas to BMWs. It saves time and helps you decide which options you can afford.

### How to ask your prospect about their spending budget.

It is important to ask the budget question in a specific way. It is important to not come across as greedy or let your prospect smell your commission breath.

Your prospect needs to understand that you must know the numbers to create a proposal that solves their business problems.

Ask your potential client **open-ended questions** to start the conversation. This will allow them to talk about their project plans, share their problems, and encourage them with further information that will help you tailor the proposal.

* Explain why you need to know your budget. "What budget can we expect to use?" This will help us to determine the time frame we can complete the project and give us a better idea about what we can do.
* Ask about past projects. This will give you a rough idea of your prospect's budget range.
* Ask them about their goals. This will give you insight into their expectations and allow you to start the conversation on pricing.

If you don't like asking questions, consider an analogy: You can build them either an ocean liner or a sailboat. Both can be built to be seaworthy. However, their budget will determine which option is best.

**Educate your clients.** Remember that this could be the first project for your client. They may not have an idea of what budget they will need. They might be looking for an estimate of the cost of the project to help them determine their budget.

You can use this opportunity to inform potential clients about your business and how you price proposals. Describe similar projects you've done in the past, and the price ranges for each. This allows people to see what kind of work you can do and allows them to decide if your prices and services are right for them.

Talking about past project budgets can help you gauge your prospect's reactions. If they are expecting a lower number, you might be able to cut the tension in the room (or the air over Zoom) by throwing out a lot of money.

No matter if you get a budget or a range, at the end of the conversation it should be clear if you can work together and if it is time to move on to the proposal stage.

**Focus on the value you can provide.** Instead of focusing on the cost of the project, let the conversation be about the results. The value your company can provide is more important than the price you charge. The ROI helps your client see into the future and predict their success.

Proposify has used value-based pricing since it changed the conversation from price to worth. It will greatly improve the sales process, help grow your business, and make it more efficient.

**Get to know the prospect.**  Make sure you are speaking with the right person when discussing the budget for a project, product, or service. This will ensure that you are part of the decision-making process when it comes time to sign the contract.

An agency was pitching to a lead but was quickly stopped by the CEO of the lead company. The lead was enthusiastic about the agency's pitch but the CEO didn't agree with the direction his employee had given to the agency. The moral of this story is that you need to make sure that the prospect you're in touch with can make decisions before you spend time on a proposal.

Even though they might not be the final decision-maker, this doesn't mean they aren't valuable to your business. They might be an influencer that convinces the decision-maker that your product/service will solve their business problems.

Recognize the role of each person you speak to and build a rapport with them. Make them feel as valued and respected as the decision-maker you are trying to reach. Involving them in the conversation is a great way to do so. Ask them if they are available to meet you.

**Take the lead.** What should you do if a prospect refuses to reveal their budget? If your prospect refuses to give you a budget, it might not be worth following them. You don't have to cut the cord.

You can use that time to pursue more qualified leads.

Although it may seem risky the first time you do it, it's not. It's a sign that you are a professional and know your ideal customer. Time is money. To be profitable, you don't want to waste time on leads who won’t finalize a budget or seem inherently flawed.

Although understandably, your client may not know their total budget upfront, after a thorough discussion, they should be able to get a better understanding of what you can offer and how much they have saved for those services.

It is crucial to know which leads you should pursue and which ones to let go to scale your business and gain customers who are willing to work with and for you to succeed.

### Summary

When you're trying to close a deal, a budget can be a difficult topic to discuss. Therefore, you need to know how to ask about budget sales with potential clients. While some clients may be more open to discussing money than others, it is a topic that must be discussed.

A budget is an essential part of the sales process. It will help you to vet leads, identify quality clients, and create winning proposals that are sure to be signed. If they seem to be playing games, be professional and tactful in your questions. But don't be afraid of walking away.

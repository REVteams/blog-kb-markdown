# What is Sales Operations?

## Definition and use of sales ops

The term “sales operations” covers a lot of ground and can mean different things to different teams and organizations. The first iterations of sales operations have been around since the 1970s, and they focused primarily on analyzing data to provide insights and direction to sales reps. Today, the roles and objectives are much broader.

At its core, sales operations is about supporting and enabling frontline sales teams to sell more efficiently and effectively by providing strategic direction and [reducing friction in the sales process](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/resources/ebook/removing-the-hidden-barriers-in-sales-processes). To do this, sales ops fulfills both strategic and tactical functions.

There are several advantages to implementing a formal sales operations team:

* Data-driven strategy and decision making
* [Streamlined sales processes](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/solutions/sales/operations)
* Improved recruiting and hiring practices
* More effective onboarding and employee training programs
* Higher productivity and sales from strategic sales coverage models and territory planning
* Smoother operations management that allows sales reps to focus on selling
* More sales!

#### Sales ops vs. sales enablement

The delineation between sales ops and sales enablement is squishy. In fact, many people use the terms interchangeably, and there is often overlap in each team’s roles.

The overarching goal for each team is the same: to increase sales effectiveness and efficiency in order to drive greater revenue.

So what’s the difference?

Organizations define each team and their roles differently. However, typically, sales enablement teams focus on supporting sales reps on the ground, often in the earlier stages of the sales funnel.

On the other hand, sales ops tends to oversee higher-level support functions—such as territory mapping, tech management, and reporting—and focuses primarily on enabling sales later in the cycle (e.g., contract negotiation and closing).

Because the structure and responsibilities of sales operations and sales enablement teams differ between organizations, we will include a broader scope of potential roles under the sales ops umbrella.

### What are the roles of sales operations?

Sales operations teams accomplish their goals through a variety of roles and functions including strategy, data analysis, hiring and training, forecasting, territory design, and [sales process optimization](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/solutions/sales/operations).

While the exact structure and functions will vary from business to business, generally these roles can be defined under four main categories:

* Strategy
* Technology
* Operations
* Performance

Here’s a brief breakdown of the primary roles of a sales ops team.

#### Strategy

One of the main roles of sales ops is to define a high-level vision for the sales organization and develop strategies to meet those goals.

A few of their strategic functions might include:

* Sales process optimization
* Sales technology and methodology evaluation
* Sales coverage model and territory planning
* High-level planning and goal setting

#### Technology

Over the past several years, there has been an exponential increase in the SaaS applications and other sales tools available to organizations. While better data and technology can promote sales, the complexity of multiple platforms can overwhelm sales reps and turn into a timesuck on the sales floor.

That’s where sales ops comes in. Their job is to manage the sales tech stack so the sales reps can focus on selling.

Here are a few ways they do that:

* Integration of apps and tools
* Adoption and customization of a CRM

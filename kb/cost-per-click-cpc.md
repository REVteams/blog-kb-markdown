One such strategy, which is widely used and extremely effective, is known as pay-per-click, or PPC, and is often related to an associated metric known as cost per click, or CPC.

#### Definition

Cost per click (CPC) is a metric used in [online advertising](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/online-advertising), which refers to a set fee that a particular advertiser pays to the online platform displaying their ad for each end-user that clicks on it. The metric is specifically related to the internet advertising model of pay per click (PPC).

#### CPC and PPC

Pay-per-click, or PPC, is the online advertising strategy that uses CPC as a measurement. Through this strategy, advertisers pay publishers only when their ad is clicked on these publishers’ platforms. Here, the role of publishers is usually filled by search engines, website owners, social media, web portals, and similar online platforms.

Through the PPC strategy, advertisers technically pay for visits to their sites rather than attract them organically. These paid ads can be seen, for instance, above organic results at the beginning of search engine pages when end-users search for particular related keywords.

As an alternative to PPC/CPC, some platforms offer the cost per impression (CPI) online advertising payment model, which is more akin to traditional pre-internet advertising. Through CPI, advertisers pay for each time their ad is displayed on the publisher’s platform — that is, for each time an end-user is able to see the ad, whether they actually click on it or not.

#### Why Is CPC Important

To advertisers who use the PPC model, CPC can be much more than the cost they pay for getting clicks. This metric is invaluable to businesses who pay for clicks to their ads, as measuring and optimizing it will help them maintain a positive [ROI](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/roi-return-on-investment-1794432) and develop profitable marketing strategies.

When an end-user clicks on a business’ PPC ad, the publisher charges the business a certain fee (the CPC), which can be negotiated before they conclude the deal. Namely, advertisers can determine the maximum amounts they’d pay publishers for each particular keyword related to their ads. Advertisers can then bid on the amounts paid for keywords with publishers based on the intent of the keyword search by users, and how important each keyword is to their business. In this case, the agreed CPC is the cost advertisers will pay for each ad click based on the keywords they’ve bid on.

Here, it’s worth mentioning that the maximum CPC businesses determine for their keywords won’t be the total cost they pay to the publishers. Instead, businesses pay just enough to surpass the [Ad Rank](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1752122?hl=en) of the closest competitor below them.

The CPC amount businesses pay has an impact on several aspects of their advertising campaign, such as the number of clicks they get for a specific budget, the [ROAS](https://www.bigcommerce.com/ecommerce-answers/what-is-roas-calculating-return-on-ad-spend/) of their campaign, the visibility of their ads, and how often they’re displayed to their target audience.

#### How To Calculate CPC

The formula for calculating CPC for an advertiser is the following:

**(Competitor Ad Rank / Advertiser’s quality score) + $0,01 = CPC**

Here, the Ad Rank is a value that determines the position of each ad when compared to others, and the quality score is the rating of the quality and relevance of an advertiser’s keywords and PPC ads. Both of these are determined by publishers.

To demonstrate this with an example, when [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/) decides on ad auctions from two different bidding advertisers, it takes the Ad Ranks for each of the two ads and quality scores of both advertisers. For example, if the highest-ranked advertiser has a quality score of 10 with an ad rank of 15 while the second-highest ranked advertiser has a quality score of 8 (so just below the first one) with an ad rank of 13, the CPC of the highest-ranked advertiser will be calculated as follows:

**13 / 10 + \$0,01 = $1,31**

An advertiser’s CPC will always be equal to or lower than their determined maximum CPC, which is the highest price they’re willing to pay per click, commonly stated on their account.

Some businesses are also interested in measuring their average CPC as a separate metric. The formula for average CPC is the following:

**Total cost of all clicks paid for / Total number of clicks received = Average CPC**

To show an example of average CPC, we’ll take an advertiser whose ad got three clicks. The first one of these clicks cost the advertiser \$1, the second one \$2, and the third one $3. To calculate the average CPC for this ad, the advertiser takes the sum of the costs they paid for all these clicks and divides it by their amount — that is, by 3, since there were 3 ad clicks. The result will be the following:

**(\$1 + \$2 + \$3) / \$3 = \$6 / \$3 = $2**

For businesses, comparing their average CPCs with their competitors (especially on a national level) helps them get a clearer image of how effectively they’re spending their advertising funds.

#### Summary

Cost per click (CPC) refers to a metric that shows advertisers the amount they pay to a publisher who displays their ad for each click this ad gets by end-users.

The CPC metric is used for a specific model of online advertising known as pay-per-click (PPC), in which advertisers only pay publishers for the end-user clicks they get on their ads. Through the PPC model, advertisers pay for generating visitors on their websites instead of gaining them organically, and their paid ads will commonly be displayed at the top of search engine results for related keywords.

The CPC metric is important for advertisers who use it, as optimizing the CPC amounts they pay to publishers will help them develop profitable marketing strategies and have a positive return on investment. Calculating their average CPCs and comparing them with those of their competitors also provides advertisers with significant insights into the financial effectiveness of their marketing strategies.

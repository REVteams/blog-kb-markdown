There are many strategies to engage customers in a way that improves their relationship to a business, and one such strategy — which is increasingly gaining traction in recent years — is known as the customer success approach.

#### Definition

The term customer success is used to describe a proactive approach or strategy that a business uses in dealing with its customers. The idea behind the customer success strategy is to anticipate the challenges customers may be facing and proactively provide them with guidance on how to make the most out of the products/services they’re paying for, with the aim of increasing customer satisfaction and ultimately driving sales and profits.

As a relatively new concept in business practice, customer success has been steadily growing in popularity recently, especially among newly successful businesses. Nowadays, more and more companies are implementing customer success departments and teams in their work environments.

#### Customer Success and Customer Support

At first glance, the concepts of customer success and [customer support](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/customer-support), together with their associated company departments, may seem like they’re essentially the same thing. At the end of the day, both customer success and customer support aim to solve customer problems, creating a better customer-business relationship as a result. In companies that have both departments, they’ll often work closely together on everything customer-related.

With that in mind, there’s a significant difference between these two concepts and strategies. This difference revolves around how businesses engage in solving their customer’s issues and concerns.

The more traditional customer support concept takes on a **retroactive** approach when dealing with the issues customers have with a business’s products or services. This means that a company’s customer support agents will commonly be working as contact persons that customers can reach out to when they have an issue with the products and/or services they’re paying for. Customers can contact a company’s customer support agents through a variety of channels, usually by phone, email, social media page messages, and live chat. The reactive role of customer support agents consists of answering these calls, messages or emails, and helping customers on their own demand and initiative.

Customer success, on the other hand, does the exact opposite, taking on a **proactive** approach instead of a retroactive one. This means that the customer success approach puts the burden on the businesses themselves to predict what challenges, issues and needs their customers may have, and what advice can come in handy for them when using the product and/or service they’re paying for. Having this in mind, businesses are the ones who reach out to their customers, helping them get more value out of the products or services they’re using, improving their [user experience](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/what-is-user-experience-and-why-you-should-care/), and instilling a sense of loyalty in them.

#### Why Is Customer Success Important?

In the contemporary market, businesses across sectors are facing ever-increasing customer acquisition costs — meaning that the costs that businesses incur to gain new customers keep growing. Having this trend in mind, for many businesses, retaining their old customers and having them return to buy more products/services or extend their subscriptions can be much cheaper than actually trying to gain new ones. Customer success operations can help greatly in this sense, as the businesses that employ a customer success approach are much more likely to develop a sense of belonging in their customers.

It’s important to note that customer support doesn’t always have the same effect on customers. While having a contact center for customer support is certainly helpful for improving customer relationships, the effect is not the same in situations where businesses proactively assist their customers as it is when customers have to contact the business themselves when they need technical support.

According to [customer experience statistics](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/50-important-customer-exp_b_8295772), only 1 in 26 customers that aren’t satisfied with a product or service will usually go out of their way to complain about it to the business’s customer support team — the others are more likely to [churn](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-churn) instead. With a proactive customer success approach, churn rates can be significantly lowered as a result of businesses solving customer issues before they even appear.

Businesses that can show they care about their customers’ success will gain more than just their loyalty. Happy and successful customers are likely to promote the businesses they’re buying from to their peers, acting as an indirect advertising team for it. This can help businesses acquire new customers and turn in more profits as a result.

#### Customer Success Management

Most companies with customer success departments also hire customer success managers, or CSMs. The task of these managers is to oversee the work of the entire customer success team. CRMs are also commonly tasked with developing a working customer success strategy for the team to follow.

Some of the responsibilities of CSMs include hiring and training customer success representatives, guiding them through their work with customers, developing a strategy best suited for active customer retention and satisfaction, dividing customers into different categories, addressing escalated customer issues beyond the scope of level 1 customer success representatives, encouraging customer feedback, analyzing customer responses to the customer success strategy, and more.

#### Summary

Customer success is a proactive approach or strategy used by businesses when dealing with their customers. Businesses who use this approach take the initiative to anticipate the challenges their customers may be facing related to the businesses’ products or services and provide them with valuable guidance on how to improve their usage, increasing their satisfaction and driving sales in the long run.

In general, the concept of customer success is very similar to that of customer support, as they both revolve around helping customers make the most out of the products and services they’re using and assisting them with any difficulties. However, the difference is that while customer support takes on a retroactive approach by responding to customer complaints, the approach of customer success is proactive, with businesses taking the initiative to reach out to their customers to improve their experience.

As customer acquisition costs rise, customer success helps businesses retain their existing customers longer, reducing the need for the costly process of acquiring new ones. Happy and successful customers are also more likely to promote the business they buy from, indirectly helping it gain new customers in the process. Customer success strategies also help businesses avoid customer churn, as they instill a sense of loyalty and trust in customers making them less likely to unsubscribe.

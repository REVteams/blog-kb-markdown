### What to do When Someone Hangs Up on You?

This question is only as good as the situation. What was the call about and why did they hang up? These two questions are crucial and can vary depending on the call.

Did this call come from a business? If so, were they unhappy or interrupted by another business? It is important to understand this information to plan your next move.

If they are acting without malice, it is probably best to get back in touch with them. It may be difficult to communicate with them again if they end the call in dissatisfaction.

What if you were calling a friend or family member? This is a completely different situation. You must still determine the nature and end of the call.

Are they crazy and trying to avoid an unpleasant conversation? Did they get another phone call? Are they trying to entice you with an abnormal level of commitment?

The first step should always be to figure out why they terminated the call. Uncertainty is the greatest challenge. Here are some key questions that will help you to weigh your options and determine the best path forward for communication.

However, none of these ideas are as valuable unless you answer this question.

If you don't know why the call ended, you will need to make blind decisions to find out more. Sometimes, this will mean contacting the person who hung up on your call again.

You can also use context clues, mutual contacts, and other forms of communication to help you better understand the situation.

If you feel you have some idea of what happened, you can look through the list to find the best option.

#### Wait for a second and see if they meant to hang up...

Hanging up is not always an intentional act. The other person may try to reach you immediately if it was unintentional or dropped calls. If you believe this to be the case, wait a few minutes to see what happens.

If they don't return your call immediately, you can determine the best course of action.

Be aware that they may not immediately be aware of the disconnect. Some confusion is possible, especially when features such as call waiting are involved. Once you are certain that they won't call you back, you can move on to the next point.

### What should you do when someone hangs up on you?

If the conversation is not completed, and you don't believe they are acting out of malice or if you are unsure, call them back. You can wait if the disconnect was accidental, but if they donâ€™t call you back immediately, you have the right to take the initiative.

You can continue the conversation or find out why they disconnected your call.

Calling one back is a good idea if you are talking to someone who isn't a friend or a personal contact. This is especially true for business calls. Even if they only have a voicemail, you can still leave a message to keep communication channels open.

#### What about a text after they hang up on you?

You can send a text message to them if calling them back is not possible or feels incongruous. Texting is an alternative to calling them back, regardless of whether it was personal or professional.

You can explain why the call ended in your text. You can explain why the call ended and offer an alternative method of communication. If necessary, you can apologize.

If they disconnect, your text message will open the door for further communication. You can either call them back or they can reply with a text message.

#### Give it more time...

All of these ideas assume that the hang-up wasn't malicious. What if it was? Imagine if you were talking with a friend and they suddenly, deliberately, hung up on your conversation.

Sometimes, it is best to not do anything right away. Give yourself some time to relax and gather your thoughts. Give the other person time to do the same.

You are unlikely to find a productive discussion if you push for a conversation with someone angry enough to quit.

You must exercise discretion. You should not wait for certain matters, but waiting can make all the difference.

#### What do you think about the situation?

Sometimes, things are not clear. It can be unexpected and disruptive. It is possible that you aren't sure if the hang-up was intentional.

These situations can be difficult for people to understand, especially when they are communicated over the phone.

Although it is not ideal to dwell on an event like this, you must consider the situation. Consider what happened and why. Try to understand the point of view of the other party.

If you can do this, you will be able to navigate the situation and find a way to resume communication.

#### Is it an emergency?

If you believe the call was an emergency, or if the call ended due to a genuine emergency then don't wait for things to settle down or think about it. Decide the best way you can help in handling the emergency.

Sometimes it is best to call the other person back and see if they can keep in touch. You might be able to get information from them that will allow you to offer remote assistance.

In some cases, it might be the best thing to get them medical attention. If you feel it is necessary, you can call the emergency services.

#### Do you need to move on?

All calls are not personal. Anyone who has ever made cold calls for a business can attest to that. Let's just assume that this is true to prove our point.

Some people will hang up when you cold call them. They will hang up on you and not continue the conversation. If this is the case, you can remove them from your list and move on.

While you don't necessarily have to give up contact, if there is no way to communicate, don't waste time.

You can even try to appreciate the fact that they refused to talk to you. Instead of getting lost in a long, drawn-out conversation, you were immediately informed that this contact was not worth your time and that you can move on with more productive endeavors.

Cold calls are not always the best way to go. If you feel there is value in continuing the conversation with them, call them back. This would happen if they had a conversation with you but were interrupted in the middle.

You'll need to decide if the contact remains valuable and how long it takes to try to reach them again. Sometimes, an immediate redial is necessary. Sometimes, finesse is necessary.

#### Can you afford to give up the call?

It might be necessary to reset if the hang-up was especially bothersome. You can usually get off the phone.

Try something completely different and reset your mind and emotions. It is difficult to move forward with work or relationships when you are feeling agitated.

You can avoid wasting your time pondering over the end of the phone call. This allows you to relax and gain a fresh perspective. You can then assess the situation and determine the best course of action.

#### Should you involve another party?

This is the most difficult thing about a hang-up. You might want to pursue a business contact in a professional setting. To do this, you can use a third-party contact.

You could also end up in an awkward situation where you drag the third party into a bad conversation. This is a difficult decision.

Sometimes that risk is worth it. Sometimes, you just make things worse. It all boils down to the inner workings and relationships.

The bottom line is that third parties are an option that should be considered and should be treated with discretion.

# What is Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

## Companies use many different calculations and metrics to measure important aspects of their business and its health. One such metric, particularly related to accounting, is known as days sales outstanding, or DSO.

#### Definition

Days sales outstanding (DSO) is a metric that shows the average number of days it takes a business to collect their due payments through invoices for their credit sales. In other words, DSO shows businesses the average number of days it takes them to collect their [accounts receivable](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-accounts-receivable) for products or services they sell on credit.

DSO is directly associated with a company’s cash flow measurements. Together with days of inventory outstanding (DIO), which also measures cash flow, and with days payables outstanding (DPO), which measures cash outflow, these three metrics make up the necessary parameters for calculating a business’s [cash conversion cycle](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/calculate-cash-conversion-cycle-393115).

#### How To Calculate DSO

DSO is measured for a particular period of multiple days. In practice, it’s most commonly measured monthly, but some companies also measure it on a quarterly or annual basis.

When measuring DSO, only credit sales are taken into account, and cash sales are excluded. This is because cash sales are direct sales with no waiting time between the date the sale was concluded and the date the selling businesses cashed in on it. This means that businesses consider cash sales to represent zero DSO, automatically excluding them from the DSO calculating equation.

To calculate their DSO for a particular time period, businesses first need to divide their total accounts receivable by their total net credit sales — both of these values having been measured for the same period in question — and then multiply the result by the number of days said period lasts. Therefore, the formula for calculating DSO for a time period will be as follows:

**(Accounts receivable / Net credit sales) x Number of days in the time period = DSO**

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a company reports that in April, it made \$5 million in sales. Out of this sum, it made \$3 million in cash sales, which will not be taken into consideration while calculating DSO. The company made the remaining \$2 million through credit sales, and this sum will be taken into account. At the end of April, for which this company measures its DSO, its accounts receivable balance’s value was $1 million.

To calculate its DSO for April, this company has to divide its accounts receivable for April (\$1 million) by its total net credit sales ($2 million) for the same month. Having in mind that April has 30 days, the equation for calculating DSO will be as follows

**(\$1 million / $2 million) x 30 = ½ x 30 = 15**

This means that the company’s DSO for April is 15 days, which is the average time it took this company to collect its accounts receivable for that month.

#### High and Low DSO

It is commonly considered that any DSO calculation that shows less than 45 days means that the DSO being measured is low. However, determining the difference between a high and a low DSO can vary from business to business. In general, what is considered to be a high (or a low) DSO is commonly very different between different business sectors and industries, with some of these values varying to a notable degree across sectors.

In simple terms, a low DSO is a sign that the business in question doesn’t take a lot of time to collect payment for its credit sales. In the same way, a high DSO means the opposite — that it does take the business many days to collect credit sales payment. For these reasons, a high DSO is generally considered undesirable whereas a low one is considered desirable, though it’s not a strict determinant in every case.

A high DSO may be a result of difficulties that a business is facing when collecting their accounts receivable, which can lead to reduced cash flow rates in the long term. In some cases, however, high DSO isn’t considered a huge issue.

For instance, large companies with many years of business experience will sometimes not consider a DSO of 50 days or more as a huge problem, as they’re likely to constantly receive income that keeps their business running and don’t necessarily feel the impact of credit sales payments arriving a bit later.

On the other hand, high DSO values can have a more severely negative effect on the cash flow of smaller businesses that don’t generate constant revenue in the same way their larger counterparts do. For small and medium businesses, timely payments for each invoice often mean a lot in financial terms. Due to the volume of smaller-scale businesses, they’re more likely to have more immediate use of every inflow of cash they receive, usually to cover their operational expenses (salaries, bills, rent, and more). Continually high DSO rates can make it more difficult for these businesses to cover their basic expenses.

Low DSO values, in turn, are a sign of a business’s effectiveness in collecting due payments. A low DSO is an especially good indicator for small and medium businesses — covering their basic expenses will leave these businesses with extra profits for reinvesting, helping them grow faster in the long term.

However, a constant low DSO is also an indicator that the business in question is very inflexible to its customers, not offering them many credits, or forcing direct payments. Such an attitude, besides the obvious advantages it has on a business’s financial situation, can sometimes have a negative impact on a business’s relationships with its customers, and by consequence, on its sales performance as well.

#### Summary

Days sales outstanding, or DSO, is a metric showing how many days on average it takes a business to collect payments for its credit sales — that is, to charge its accounts receivable. This metric, together with days of inventory outstanding (DIO) and days payables outstanding (DPO), is used by businesses when they calculate their cash conversion cycle.

Businesses calculate their DSO for a particular period which is usually a month, even though calculating DSO on a yearly and a quarterly basis is also common. DSO is calculated by dividing a business’s accounts receivable for a time period by its net credit sales for the same period and then multiplying this result by the number of days that make up the period in question.

A high DSO value may be indicative of a business’s difficulties to charge for its due credit payments. While larger companies that receive a more constant income may be less affected by higher DSO measurements, smaller-scale businesses will likely feel a more severe impact from them, as they’re more likely to depend on timely payments for their operational expenses.

A low DSO value means that a business is effective at collecting its credit sales payments more quickly. Low DSO values are especially helpful for smaller-scale businesses in the financial sense, as collecting income on time helps them grow more quickly. On the other hand, constantly low DSO values may also be indicative of a business’s rigidness when offering credits to its customers, which can sometimes have a bad impact on its relationship with them.

In the process, many businesses practice gathering data about their customers and prospects. This helps them get a better understanding of the targets they’re selling to as well as those they aim to sell to, which ultimately leads to [closing more deals](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal), driving sales, and increasing profits in the process. One way of gathering data about (potential) customers is by consulting firmographics.

#### Definition

Firmographics — sometimes called emporographics, or firm demographics — are sets of characteristics attributed to organizations such as businesses and companies. Firmographics are commonly used by B2B businesses that consult them as a means of gathering data about organizations they sell to or are interested in selling to.

#### Firmographics and Demographics

A simple way of describing firmographics is by comparing them to [demographics](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/demographics-definition). In essence, firmographics are demographics for organizations. While demographics are used to gather relevant data about individuals, firmographics provide data about organizations, notably businesses.

Demographics are, thus, important for business-to-customer [B2C](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2c) businesses, which sell their products and/or services to individual customers directly. Firmographics, on the other hand, are used by [B2B](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2b) businesses — that is, businesses that (mostly) deal in selling to other businesses as their main economic activity.

The data that businesses gather by analyzing demographics can include the following characteristics of individuals:

* Age;
* Gender;
* Ethnicity;
* Income;
* Level of education;
* Occupation;
* Family structure;
* And other data related to personal characteristics.

Firmographics, on the other hand, show relevant information about organizations, such as:

* Geographic location;
* Industry — often by using [Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)](https://siccode.com/) codes;
* Technological sophistication level;
* Size;
* Performance;
* Structure
* And more.

With that in mind, ultimately, firmographics and demographics share some core similarities. Both concepts are used to gather data about particular target audiences (whether they’re made up of individuals or organizations) that businesses want to reach out to on the market. Another important thing firmographics and demographics have in common is that they’re both employed by businesses when constructing the profiles of their ideal customers — those that are most likely to purchase from these businesses and provide them with value in return.

#### Why Are Firmographics Important

There are numerous benefits from analyzing firmographics that businesses can make use of, mostly related to improving their strategies, helping them focus on qualified prospects, engaging customers, and more.

### Sales and Marketing Strategy

Information gathered from firmographics is often used by B2B businesses to optimize their sales and marketing strategies. This is because this information can help businesses understand the presence of particular companies in different markets, as well as what kinds of products or services they’re placing on these markets. Businesses can use this knowledge to come up with estimates of the areas in which they can concentrate their sales and marketing efforts.

Firmographics also help businesses get better insights into data trends, which helps them evaluate how their response to data changes over time. Knowing this is also useful for businesses that aim to formulate better marketing strategies.

### Focusing on the Prospects That Matter

By analyzing firmographics, B2B businesses can also make better plans on how to generate leads and prospects. At first, it might take businesses some time when analyzing firmographic data. However, once they get the hang of it, they will actually save time for generating more qualified prospects — which are much more likely to be [converted](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) into paying customers — since firmographics can help them focus on these and avoid less qualified leads.

In a way, firmographic data helps businesses take advantage of all the opportunities they’re given by grasping the scope of the marketplace they can sell to, while at the same time helping them save time by moving their focus away from leads that don’t really present a selling opportunity.

### Customer Engagement

Through gathering filmographic data about their customer organizations, businesses can also [engage](https://rev.team/kb/engagement) them better. Knowing relevant information about their target audience helps businesses personalize their approach to paying customers and prospects alike, which in turn contributes to creating a bond with these organizations. This is a huge boost to the relationship businesses maintain with their audience, making it far more likely to entertain a positive attitude towards these businesses, and ultimately more likely to purchase from them, as well.

### Determining Customer Profiles

Providing businesses with insights on what kinds of organizations are more likely to buy their products or services is another key aspect of firmographics. These insights help businesses predict the consumer behavior of their customers, which they can use to offer them similar products or services and retain them as clients in the long run.

### Slashing Costs and Increasing Revenue

At the end of the day, analyzing firmographics doesn’t cost businesses much, so the data they gain in this way helps them save money they’d otherwise have to spend on more elaborate tools to help them reach their marketing goals.

What’s more, the marketing and sales strategy optimization that businesses can achieve through processing firmographic data will ultimately give them a steady return on investment, which means they’ll get increased profits in the long run.

#### Summary

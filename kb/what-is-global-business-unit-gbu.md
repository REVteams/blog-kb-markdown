# What is a Global Business Unit (GBU)?

## Many different types of businesses are often organized on a national as well as international level. When it comes to multinational companies, in particular, they operate in multiple different countries at the same time.

Within the group operations of multinational companies, they often implement global business units, or GBUs.

#### Definition

The term global business unit (GBU) refers to a department in a multinational company, which exists to support the global business activities of the company’s local and international [customers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) alike. To achieve this, GBUs are specialized in providing an in-depth and well-established global network for distributing products and services that the multinational company deals in. The focus of GBUs are single market verticals, or sometimes multiple goods, services, or functions globally.

#### How Companies Use Global Business Units

When business activities involve enterprises from at least two different countries, they fall into the category of international business. International business and domestic business share many similarities, but they also differ in an aspect that is particularly important to GBUs. 

When it comes to doing international business, multinational companies have to tackle several complex aspects of this practice. These include dealing with a range of policies on trade, foreign investment controls, different currencies, diverse [client](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) characteristics, etc. 

These companies can undertake various initiatives to create synergies, increase their group’s general strength, and improve the earnings capacities of their group’s enterprises as well as the companies they invested in. 

Also, by simplifying operational structures, strengthening corporate governance systems, and making sure that there is a stable procurement of foreign currencies, these companies can bolster up business platforms that contribute to sustainable growth.

#### Why Are Global Business Units Important

There are several benefits of having a GBU. Most notably, these benefits include boosting profitability, setting up business foundations, and business expansion.

### Boosting Profits 

GBUs allow companies to boost their profitability. To successfully do this, they have to make the most of group strengths, including product and service expertise and global networks. By doing so, they’re able to provide solutions that are integrated and group-wide.

Companies also tackle the business issues of customers through GBUs as well as some of their social issues in order to improve profitability. In this way, they’re establishing and fostering multi-faceted business relationships with them. 

Companies can also boost their profitability by launching initiatives that don’t result in a substantially expanded balance sheet while focusing on improving the efficiency of assets and capital at the same time.

### Setting up Business Foundations 

Rapidly changing aspects, such as fluctuations, geopolitical risks, and the like, are leading to more complex global operations. To streamline these operations, a GBU is allocating resources that make its risk management and corporate governance processes stronger. 

Companies can also keep on simplifying their operations by reviewing marketing frameworks and making sure administrative roles are consolidated. This helps them retain funds that they can use in priority fields, or invest in new businesses.

### Business Expansion

With the help of GBUs, companies can make their business foundations stronger and establish financial services. By establishing relationships with middle-tier enterprises via intra-group cooperation, a company’s foundation can be optimized for medium to long-term growth.

In addition, the GBU helps companies in the process of expanding their operations to different countries and taking part in digital technology-related projects simultaneously, aiming to capture the growth of the region.

#### How to Build a Successful Global Business Unit

There are various strategies that companies can use to build a successful GBU. These include selecting the appropriate base model, measuring the GBU value, incentive synchronization between GBU and local operations, knowing the capabilities’ value, and fostering a strong relationship.

### Selecting the Appropriate Base Model 

Through thorough group context analysis and the GBU strategy, companies can select the right model for the given environment. There are three main types of base models for GBUs, including:

* The first base model, which uses a central sharing unit for best practices, is the most easily implementable model for a GBU. This model is suitable if you want the GBU to have a great regional variation or if the GBU doesn’t need a global infrastructure.
* The second base model for a GBU owns the investment budget and gains its profit and loss while the local operation owns execution. The GBU experts are expected to create a strategy and do the execution in a cost-efficient way via local operations.
* Finally, the third model is the most difficult one to implement. However, it provides the highest level of versatility. This model allows the GBU’s work to be independent of the operations of other groups, although it fails to account for the challenge that emerges when two groups work simultaneously within a single country. 

### Measuring the GBU Value 

In order to be able to point out their significance to the relevant stakeholders, the GBUs should be able to present their value in quantifiable terms. This implies the need for a clear GBU communication strategy. 

Communicating the value of a GBU should entail including the [key performance indicator](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator) in reporting and governance processes, as well. Additionally, it’s advisable for promoters within the business to stress the value that the GBU brings. 

### Incentive Synchronization Between GBU and Local Operations

To a certain degree, GBUs can work together with local operations. Because of this, it is of utmost importance for companies to support the advancement of the GBU proposition through the incentive framework. In the process, companies also need to foresee and remove all the obstacles that prevent the GBU proposition from growing.

### Understanding How Valuable GBU Capabilities Are

One of the main reasons for the creation of GBUs is to help companies start new business lines, launch new products or services, and implement new technologies. However, this often means that at the moment of establishing GBUs, companies usually haven’t tested their capabilities and don’t have a clear picture of the value they can offer.  

For instance, data capability may seem like a good thing for companies to offer through their GBUs. However, besides the benefits it brings, offering data capability can be a difficult task. Different legal regulations such as data sharing between different countries, as well as operational obstacles, can make the process of offering data capability hard to implement. 

The fastest and most effective way to get a grasp of GBU capabilities is through trial and error. At first, companies should develop educated guesses about what capabilities their GBU can provide, and then find a non-disruptive way to test their guesses and measure the value that these capabilities bring to the GBU first-hand. To do this, they’ll also need to determine how these capabilities fit into their global [operating model](https://opexsociety.org/body-of-knowledge/operating-model/).

### Fostering a Strong Relationship

At the end of the day, the GBU must also maintain a positive rapport with every stakeholder, which is something no incentive structure, no matter how beneficial, can replace. There should be a sense of genuine trust and respect developed between the GBU and its stakeholders. What’s more, GBUs should be familiar with their stakeholders and know when they can afford to promote themselves among them, while at the same time respecting their barriers. 

#### Summary

A global business unit (GBU) is a department in a multinational company that supports the business activities of the company’s customers by providing them with a well-established global network for distributing products and services. 

Multinational companies use GBUs when doing international business, where they are faced with some challenges such as differing international trade policies, foreign investment controls, different currencies, diverse client characteristics, and more. To aid them in their endeavor, multinationals can undertake various initiatives to improve their group’s standing.

GBUs improve a company’s profitability by making use of their group strengths, tackling the issues of their customers, and helping them launch initiatives that focus on improving the efficiency of assets and capital. They also help companies set up their business foundations. What’s more, they can help them expand their businesses and expand their operations to different countries.

To build a successful GBU, companies need to follow a few steps, starting by picking the right base model. There are three main base models — a lighter model which uses a central sharing unit for best practices, a medium model based on owning the investment budget and gains its profit and loss while the local operation owns execution, and a more difficult model that allows the GBU’s work to be independent of the operations of other groups. 

From there on, companies need to proceed to quantify the value of the GBU to relevant stakeholders. They also need to synchronize incentives between their GBUs and their local operations. The next step on the way to creating a successful GBU is to understand the value of the capabilities they want their GBUs to provide. Finally, they must also establish and maintain strong relationships with their stakeholders, based on trust and respect.

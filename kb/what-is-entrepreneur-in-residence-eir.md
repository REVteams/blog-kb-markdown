# What is Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR)?

## In the past decades up to this day, the concept of entrepreneurship has played a crucial part in modern business and economic theory as well as practice.

Entrepreneurs are defined as people who possess the initiative and bravery to start new businesses and lead them to commercial success, generating profit for themselves and often providing work for multiple employees in the process. With that in mind, as the main driving force behind businesses, entrepreneurs can play different roles and hold different positions within them. One such position, usually held by entrepreneurs and particularly important in the field of venture capital, is known as entrepreneur in residence, or EIR for short.

#### Definition

The term entrepreneur in residence (EIR) — or, in some cases, executive in residence — is used to describe a position in various types of companies, commonly [venture capital](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4252-venture-capital.html) firms but also other businesses, through which they host successful entrepreneurs coming from outside business, typically for a short time period of several months and up to a year. In some cases, these venture capital (and other) firms can also host executives that aren’t necessarily the entrepreneurs of their companies (typically the most successful [C-Suite executives](https://rev.team/kb/c-level-c-suite-executives)) to assume the role of EIRs.

Through this practice, venture capital firms tend to employ entrepreneurs or executives who have led (or are still leading) emerging start-up companies that are generally considered successful in terms of their growth rate. The role of EIRs is to create new opportunities for the firms that host them.

#### EIRs and Venture Capital Firms

Venture capital firms have been the first to host EIRs and remain the largest practitioners of EIR hosting to date. While different types of companies can employ EIRs nowadays, the term is still mostly used to refer to short-term positions offered by venture capital firms in particular.

The way venture capital usually works is by finding investment opportunities in start-ups, early-stage, and emerging businesses that are deemed promising, which venture capitalists invest in with the hopes of getting a return on their investment when these businesses achieve their potential. In practice, venture capital firms usually find a suitable promising upstart company to invest in first, and then evaluate its management (entrepreneurs or executives) to establish whether they’re resilient enough to receive their investment.

When searching for EIRs to host, however, venture capital firms do it the other way around. First, they find entrepreneurs and managers that used to run successful firms, or, in some cases, are still running them. Then, they employ these successful entrepreneurs on a short-term basis, tasking them to create new start-ups. The reason behind this is that entrepreneurs that have made a name for themselves are likely to start new businesses with great potential that these venture capital firms can invest in, and expect a solid return on investment from them later on.

Sometimes, these experienced entrepreneurs already have an idea of their next successful business adventure and need several months (usually 6 to 12) to develop their business plans into actual start-ups. In such cases, venture capital firms take these entrepreneurs on during this time period, providing them financial and logistical support until their plans come to fruition and they actually develop new companies worthy of investing in.

In essence, by hosting EIRs, venture capital firms show that they’ve recognized the capacities of a start-up entrepreneur or executive, and are willing to support them by providing them with funding for their upcoming projects. With this in mind, the idea behind hosting EIRs is not to provide high-paid job posts for entrepreneurs to fill at venture capital firms. On the contrary, EIR posts are supposed to be part-time, temporary positions for entrepreneurs that might even be already employed in their own companies — they’re only supposed to develop the next investing adventures for venture capital firms to undertake.

### The Role of an EIR in a Venture Capital Firm

While their role is often temporary, EIRs are usually hired similarly to other employees in venture capital firms, often getting office desks to work from, administrative support, business cards, and more from their hosts. Once hired, EIRs can perform a variety of tasks in their venture capital environments, often related to doing business research and attending meetings.

An important part of an EIR’s work within a venture capital firm consists of working with its general partners and sometimes assisting their hosts’ [portfolio companies](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/portfolio-company/) as well. What’s more, venture capital firms will usually put the EIR they host in charge of evaluating new investment opportunities, especially for start-ups coming from those industries where their EIRs built their careers. EIRs are also commonly tasked with helping out with due diligence on the firm’s prospective investments.

Oftentimes, EIRs participate in pitch meetings with higher-ups in venture capital firms, where other entrepreneurs promote their business ideas to the firms with the hope of getting their investment. They can also participate in internal meetings where the staff of venture capital firms gathers to discuss investments in general.

EIRs can have several benefits from being hosted by venture capital firms. For one thing, they’ll get to meet many other entrepreneurs and key figures in various start-up companies that have a potential for growth, learning from their experience while assisting them all at the same time. From the internal meetings they attend, EIRs will also gain invaluable knowledge of how venture capital firms make key decisions related to investing their capital in early-stage companies.

Venture capital firms also benefit from hosting EIRs in many ways. EIRs provide venture capital firms with a cheap way to give consulting to their portfolio companies, assist them with reviewing pitches as well as with due diligence, help them source proprietary deals through their connections with other promising entrepreneurs looking for investments, and more.

Because of all this, EIR hiring is usually a mutually beneficial relationship for all parties. EIRs manage to bring their hosts a return on their investment in them more often than not, and in turn, they receive financial support as well as exposure to many factors they may find important for their future professional growth.

#### EIRs Outside Venture Capital Firms

While EIRs are traditionally hosted by venture capital firms, other companies can make use of their expertise as well. Notably, similar companies such as private equity funds or startup accelerators can have more or less the same use of EIRs as venture capital firms do.

Apart from these, EIRs are also often hired by [business schools](https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/business-school/), law firms, and a number of other kinds of organizations as well. Business schools, for instance, task the EIRs they host with helping their [MBA](https://www.bschools.org/faq/what-is-an-mba) students when they launch their own start-ups as well as with sharing their expertise with students and professors alike. Law firms, in turn, use EIRs to provide their clients with professional services, often related to guidance with venture decisions.

#### Summary

An entrepreneur in residence (EIR), sometimes called executive in residence, is usually an experienced and successful entrepreneur hired by a venture capital firm (or sometimes another type of business), typically for a short period of time (several months). In some cases, an executive that isn’t necessarily an entrepreneur can also assume the role of EIR. Hosting companies hire EIRs that have led (or are still leading) successful start-ups and task them with creating new investment opportunities for them.

Traditionally, EIRs are mostly employed by venture capital firms and are usually associated with them. When looking for EIRs to host, venture capital firms find successful entrepreneurs and managers of start-ups and then task them with creating new businesses they can invest in, relying on their EIRs’ expertise as a guarantee for the return of their investment.

In some cases, the entrepreneurs hired as EIRs already have a solid idea of their new venture and are developing a business plan. In this case, venture capital firms host these entrepreneurs as EIRs as a means of providing financial support to their ideas, showing that they see value and potential in them.

However, the EIR position isn’t supposed to be highly paid or full-time. On the contrary, EIRs are commonly hired part-time and for a short time period of several months (usually 6 to 12), which is the time they need to develop new start-up companies that their host venture capital firms can invest in.

In a venture capital firm, EIRs are often hired as regular employees. They can be assigned several different tasks, such as working with their host firm’s general partners, assisting its portfolio companies, evaluating new investment opportunities (especially for start-ups coming from the industry they have experience with), helping out on due diligence, participating in pitch meetings as well as investment discussions, and more.

EIRs benefit from their hosts in various ways: they get to meet other entrepreneurs and learn from their experiences, get insights into how venture capital firms decide on where to invest, and more. Hosting EIRs is also beneficial for venture capital firms, as they get cheap consulting for their portfolio companies, assistance with pitches, due diligence, as well as sourcing proprietary deals through the connections of their EIRs with other entrepreneurs looking for investments, and more.

Apart from venture capital firms, other companies can sometimes hire EIRs, too. Private equity funds and startup accelerators, which function in a way similar to that of venture capital firms, can likewise have a similar use of EIRs. Many different kinds of organizations, such as business schools, law firms, and more, can also use the assistance of EIRs.

# What is Equity?

## All businesses have owners — either a single one or multiple shareholders. Oftentimes, a business’s owners are also its founders — which is particularly the case with small businesses — and have invested their own money in its creation.

This base investment is considered the foundation of what is known as the owner’s equity, a concept used to evaluate how much their business (or their share in it) is worth.

#### Definition

In business terminology, the term equity refers to the value of assets after deducting the debts or other liabilities attached to them. In other words, it’s the value of a business once it will have paid back everything it owes to third parties.

Equity is often called shareholder equity, or owners’ equity in case a business has a single owner, since it’s directly related to the value that all shareholders (or the sole owner) hold within a business. If the business pays off all of its debts and takes care of every other liability, and if it then liquidates all assets, the shareholder equity is what the shareholders would be left with as the total value from the liquidation.

#### How to Calculate Equity

Equity is an important category in accounting, and companies specify it in their [balance sheets](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/balance-sheet/). Financial analysts often use equity as a measure of how financially healthy a company is.

To calculate the equity of an owner or shareholder, the following formula is used:

**Assets - Liabilities = Equity**

Here, the assets can represent various items of value that the business owns, including different kinds of property — inventory, trademarks, patents, and so on. Assets are generally divided into tangible assets (any physical item owned by a business, such as computers, vehicles, and so on, falls under this category) or intangible assets (non-physical items owned by the business such as copyrighted materials or intellectual property).

Liabilities, on the other hand, constitute future economic payments to be made to third parties because of past transactions or other past events. In practice, liabilities mostly refer to debts that a business has incurred and has to pay off. An example of this would be loans that a business may take to buy operational equipment.

Much like shareholder equity, assets and liabilities for particular time periods can also be found in the balance sheets that companies keep.

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a company with multiple shareholders has a total of **\$300,000** in assets at a certain date. At the same time, it has a total of **$100,000** in all kinds of liabilities that it needs to pay off to third parties. To calculate its shareholder equity, the company would have to use the following equation:

**\$300,000 - \$100,000 = $200,000**

This means that, for that particular date, the company accounts for **$200,000** in total shareholder equity.

#### The Importance of Equity

In essence, measuring a business’s equity means subtracting what it owes from what it owns. The relationship between the two is an important indicator of the financial health and sustainability of a business. Financial analysts commonly measure company health using its shareholder equity, and so do potential investors evaluate this metric before deciding to invest in a particular company. However, shareholder equity is not the only metric to keep in mind when analyzing a company’s financial health, but when combined with other similar metrics, analysts and investors can get a more accurate image of the health of each company they’re analyzing.

Companies use their equity as a way to raise capital with the aim of purchasing more assets, making investments, and funding operations. Investors are usually particularly interested in making equity investments because through these, they have a better chance to partake in the profit of the companies they invest in. Here, the equity shows how valuable an investor’s stake in the company is — that is, what part of its shares they control.

For shareholders, owning parts of a business’s shareholder equity (in the form of individual stocks) is important because it provides them with an opportunity to make capital gains, to vote on future company activities, to elect directors to the board, and other benefits.

With that in mind, a company’s shareholder equity can be defined as either positive or negative. A company has positive equity when it has more assets than liabilities, and vice versa — negative equity means that the company in question doesn’t have enough assets to take care of its liabilities. Negative shareholder equity is a bad sign for investors, and if a particular company maintains it for a prolonged time period, it can be considered [insolvent](https://www.companydebt.com/faqs/what-is-insolvency/).

#### Private Equity

When it comes to companies that are [publicly traded](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/basics/publicly-traded-companies/), their shares are available on the open market for anyone to buy and trade. Thus, the value of their shareholder equity is also publicly visible and shown through the price of its shares and market capitalization.

However, for companies that aren’t publicly traded — also known as privately held companies — the value of their equity isn’t publicly available. The evaluation of the value of such companies is done in a specific way and is generally referred to as private equity.

Private equity is made up of funds and investors that make investments in privately held companies, or sometimes in buying out publicly traded companies as well, which delists them from public equity.

Private equity investments are commonly done by specialized private equity firms. A big part of the funds for private equity also comes from [venture capitalists](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4252-venture-capital.html), which look to invest in start-up, early-stage, and emerging businesses that show potential, hoping to get a return of investment further down the line. [Angel investors](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-angel-investors/) are also common contributors to private equity investments — these investors offer funds to promising start-ups in exchange for equity or royalties.

#### Summary

Equity is a term used in business terminology, used to describe the value of a business by deducting its liabilities from its assets. Equity is also known as shareholder (or owner) equity.

Equity is an important concept in accounting and is written in the balance sheets of companies. To calculate their shareholder equity, companies take their total assets for a certain time period and subtract their total liabilities from them.

A business’s assets represent its items of value and different kinds of property. Businesses can have tangible assets as well as intangible assets. A business’s liabilities, on the other hand, designate its obligations to make payments to third parties because of past engagements with them, such as indebtment.

Equity represents the relationship between the value of what a business owns and the value of what it owes third parties. As such, it is significant for determining a business’s financial health.

For investors, equity investments are a priority, as they provide them with an opportunity to partake in the profit of the companies they invest in. For shareholders, owning parts of the total shareholder equity of their business gives a number of benefits, as well. Shareholder equity can either be positive or negative

Private equity is a special concept applied to privately held companies. It’s made up of funds or investors that invest in privately held companies or buy out public ones. Funds for private equity commonly come from private equity firms that specialize in such investments, and in some cases by venture capitalists and angel investors as well.

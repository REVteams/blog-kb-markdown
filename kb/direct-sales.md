# What are Direct Sales?

## The bulk of any business’s commercial activity usually consists of selling products and/or services to buyers. Based on whether sales are done through third parties or not, sales can generally be divided into two groups: indirect and direct sales.

#### Definition

Direct sales is a term used to describe the process of businesses selling their products/services directly to their customers or [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client), without any third-party intermediaries. Direct selling can be done online through a business’s website or social media pages, at the workplace in direct contact with customers, at the customer’s homes or workplaces during door-to-door sales, or in any other location outside a retail environment.

#### Direct Sales vs. Indirect Sales

The concept of direct sales — as the name itself suggests — is generally opposed to that of indirect sales. As opposed to direct selling, indirect selling is done through third parties, such as partners, affiliates, or retailers.

Any business that needs a third party to sell products or services is predominantly using the indirect sales concept. For instance, the Coca-Cola company needs wholesalers to help it sell its products to its end-users, which means it does business through indirect selling. End-users can’t go directly to a Coca-Cola production plant, or to the company’s website, to buy a can of drink from it.

As opposed to indirect sales, businesses that don’t necessarily rely on intermediaries often use the direct sales model. A good example of direct selling would be [Slack](https://slack.com/), a software company that sells its products (notably its business communication platform) to other businesses directly through its website.

#### Why Are Direct Sales Important

Through direct sales, businesses distribute their products or services directly to their end-users, without the assistance of intermediaries in the supply chain. This eliminates the costs associated with reselling. During indirect sales, businesses first sell their items to intermediaries at a primary price. Then, the intermediaries add their commission to this price, making the price effectively higher for buyers. Through direct sales, businesses avoid the price increase caused by the intermediaries’ commission. 

During direct selling, the manufacturer passes the produced items directly to the sales company, which then passes them on to their sales representatives or distributors, whose task is to sell them to the end-users. The products or services that are sold directly are often unavailable through retailers and wholesalers. This gives the sales company’s representatives/distributors an important role, as for end-users, they’re usually the single point of contact when buying.

Direct sales are especially used by network [marketing companies](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/the-network-marketing-business-model-is-it-right-for-you-3515493) who use pre-developed networks of persons to sell directly to end-users, as well as by [B2B](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2b) sellers who often send their sales representatives directly to the premises of the businesses they’re trying to sell products or services to. 

#### Direct Sales Types

There are three major methods of direct selling: single-level, host/party-plan, and multi-level marketing (MLM). These sales types are not mutually exclusive, and many businesses combine them when doing direct sales. 

### Single-Level Direct Sales

During single-level sales, a representative approaches an individual buyer directly to sell to them. A common way of doing single-level sales is by going door-to-door with individual or business customers and offering them products or services. Other ways include in-person presentations with individuals, online meetings, catalogs, and more. 

Single-level sales representatives are commonly paid by the business employing them through commissions depending on their personal sales performance, and in some cases, they can also get bonuses for reaching particular sales goals. Unlike other direct sales models, single-level representatives depend solely on their own success at closing sales when receiving their commission, and they don’t have to recruit more representatives for the business employing them in order to get paid more.

### Host or Party-Plan Direct Sales

This direct sales type, unlike its single-level counterpart, targets multiple sales prospects at once in groups. Sales representatives usually do this by organizing social events where they try to sell products or services to the audience.

During this kind of event, apart from sales, representatives can also focus on recruiting. In this way, they access both their potential customers and their potential co-workers, who can be offered the opportunity to organize the same kind of social event for the business should they agree to do so. 

### Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)

The bulk of the work of [multi-level marketing](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0065-multi-level-marketing-businesses-and-pyramid-schemes) representatives consists of creating a network of other representatives — often personal acquaintances, close friends, or even family — which they recruit to work for the same business. As such, recruiting other members is the main focus of MLM representatives, and actually selling products or services comes second.

The number of additional team members that MLM representatives manage to recruit has a direct impact on their own commission. As a rule in MLM sales, senior representatives get a cut of the commission for the sales closed by the members they recruit.

This is arguably the most controversial among all direct sales methods, and can often incur negative reactions on the part of the audience it targets. It often comes off as an intrusive and even aggressive sales model. While the MLM model is useful for those who prefer working on their own and outside traditional business environments, it also carries some significant downsides, such as sales targets that are tough to reach, commissions that require constant recruitment of new members, and sometimes even upfront participation fees.

#### Summary

Direct sales are a type of sales that occur when businesses sell their products or services directly to buyers, without the intermediation of third parties. As such, they’re the direct opposite of indirect sales, which are done through third parties such as partners, retailers, and wholesalers. 

Through direct selling, businesses avoid the costs that would otherwise be incurred by third parties reselling their products or services to end-users. As businesses that engage in direct sales often don’t offer their products and services through retail at all, their sales representatives and distributors assume the important role of being the single point of contact for potential buyers.

There are three types of direct sales: single-level sales, host or party/plan sales, and multi-level marketing (MLM). During single-level sales, representatives offer products and services to individual buyers directly. Host or party/plan sales, on the other hand, are done with a group of prospects, usually as a social event during which representatives try to sell products or services and also potentially recruit new salespeople. MLM salespeople mostly focus on recruiting new co-workers, and their commission often depends on the sales their recruits close. Of all three methods, MLM has the most negative reputation among the general public.

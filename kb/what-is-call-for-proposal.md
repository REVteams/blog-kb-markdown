For this purpose, they often practice sending out requests known as calls for proposals to the wider public where they can find potential sellers of the products or services they’re interested in. 

#### Definition

A call for proposal — also known as a request for proposal — is the process by which an organization, usually a company or government body, asks for a product or service to be sold to them. Each call for proposal comes in the form of an official document describing the details of the organization’s reasons for issuing it.

Calls for proposals work in the form of **bids** during which the most qualified and/or the lowest bidder is chosen as a contractor and allowed to sell their products or services to the organization. The bidders usually compete to win their potential clients’ business. Calls for proposals determine the details of the bidding process as well as those of the contract to be signed.

Finding contractors through calls for proposals is a preferred way of functioning for most companies and other organizations. This is especially true for governmental institutions, which often have the obligation to go through with calls for proposals — most commonly known as requests for proposals, or [RFPs](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=1bea65ab0bf2fbb67e928efe4b4d98d3bc8f553c-1615984406-0-AfGnzxBvYKwe54F9FMjYzCFlMnmnxhQ3Rm0RkisBUHNPOMh21uk4Kkf6pJpf7noL7wRrKwoMiq74KJEq4drf9vW9XH4aubXpTXCA04JOTPB7w-H4dsOPF8AiQICAZUEjz1jxsnXKRZwupKGvG9kuea7O2MAUnsjejH9oUPROiw27def2ApqHZ8dEOtahD_nXRIJzIY6hlViVx5-hbWeft8cE9_7GLxrrRBPWPL60d7fA04OZ5Dnh6Z0OPzAG72NFRyv9HAh2y2msjmTX015RBdhmlJonEOIl27w_OOsxlyf0SK9UF8j0opHlSLL7W2X-Uz8888oN1UCCj-mgMzFhgOUB01WN4xOH4BvbvQPLjHuHvkZ9huWAoaJSY5CZqvgJR8ePERPKbfu6IeZfKG7cGGsVRpVkgflb4Dy-WyU31JxrlWC6YEyrjoffxrkpGDuLZRlRpOS3_QD9Yk4DjWB0KJjtZ5EeqgHcKqf5GRsIUsbkcJZhYckUGPeGnma2go8eBIXyLizlhv0mhnDkVk9hxjEKEaENhlRV3e6_ih2V1nrlSs-654HvOKAf-ahK3inkhA) — when looking for bidders to contract for the needs of their projects, as this practice is indicative of the transparency of these organizations’ work.

#### How Calls for Proposals Work

In general, organizations issue calls for proposals when they have a more complex purchase need. For example, a call for proposal can be issued by an organization that seeks bidders qualified to work on projects that require a higher level of expertise in certain fields. Another example would be when an organization wants to buy products that aren’t easily available on the market. Sometimes, these products have yet to be produced, and the call is issued to find contractors that have the ability to do the necessary research to begin producing them so that they can then sell them to the organization.

As a rule, calls for proposals include a detailed description of what the project contractors will be working on, or the products they’re supposed to sell to the issuing organization, as well as details about this organization itself and its field of work. Organizations are also usually obliged to include the criteria used for grading proposals and choosing the right one in their calls for proposals. Sometimes, a call for proposal may also include a [statement of work](https://www.villanovau.com/resources/contract-management/what-is-statement-of-work/) that elaborates on concrete goals to be achieved by the contractor, as well as the timeframe for the project. 

Usually, calls for proposals also include instructions on how to formulate the proposals. These often instruct the bidders on the kind of information they need to provide, as well as the format in which they’re supposed to submit a proposal.

#### The Process

The call for proposal process includes several stages. At first, an organization drafts its call for proposal. The bidders then go through the draft and suggest changes. The organization then addresses their feedback. 

After this initial procedure, the organizations send out the finalized call for proposal. At this point, the interested bidders apply with their own proposals.

At this point, the organization usually shortlists a select group of bidders that it considers the most likely candidates. The organization then negotiates certain details with these bidders, such as the price, technicalities, and so on. Eventually, the company can ask these bidders to finalize an offer in the hope of winning over their business.

Finally, the organization picks the solution that fits most from among these shortlisted bidders. The chosen bidder then becomes a contractor and starts selling their products or services to the organization.

#### Where Can Calls for Proposals Be Used

Many industries can employ calls for proposals to engage contractors. Because of this, one of the common ways to classify calls for proposals is by industry. Some common branches that use calls for proposals include: 

* **Marketing** — Calls for proposals in the marketing industry are sent out to marketing agencies by companies seeking to develop a marketing strategy or obtain different kinds of marketing material. 
* **Branding** — Branding calls for proposals are issued by companies that need help with developing their brand, creating branding strategies, and more.
* **Public relations** — Organizations can also send calls to PR companies for the purpose of buying PR-related services from them, such as writing press releases, protecting their brand, and more.  
* **Website development** — In the website-related business branches, companies regularly send out calls for proposals to web developers for the needs of developing and maintaining sites for them. 
* **Graphic design** — Graphic designers also sell their work to organizations that issue calls for proposals in this field, offering them different graphics-related services in areas such as web design, poster design, and more. 
* **Technology** — When it comes to calls for proposals for product purchase, companies will often solicit vendors of technological solutions such as computers, projectors, printers, and more. 
* **Government projects** — For governmental bodies, issuing calls for proposals, or requests for proposals as they usually refer to them, is a common practice more than anywhere else. Any kind of procurement for official governmental organizations, from purchasing products to soliciting expert services, usually follows this procedure.
* And many others.

#### Summary

The term call for proposal, alternatively known as a request for proposal, is used to refer to a process by which organizations ask for products or services to be sold to them. The way it chooses the seller is through a bid, and bidders usually compete with each other to become the organization’s contractor.

Organizations usually send out calls for proposals for more complex projects that require a certain amount of expertise. In their calls for proposals, organizations should describe the criteria they’ll use to select contractors.

A typical call for proposal includes information on the organization and the nature of the project for which the contractors are hired. It should also guide bidders on how to format their proposals.

Calls for proposals can be used across many industries and business sectors, such as marketing, graphic design, public relations, technology, the governmental sector, and more.

Sales Cadence is your most powerful weapon to crush those targets month after month. Most salespeople simply gather a few templates or scripts to help them reach out to prospects.

It's like playing an instrument with no rhythm. You can only hear a raucous sound. After launching the cadence, you will realize the results are disappointing.

Sales reps should know how to create a sales cadence that will produce good results. 

Your sales strategy should consist of a series of touch points that use the right channels. When orchestrated, it should sound like a concert. You should also be able to engage effectively with prospects at scale.

How can you create a sales strategy that will make you the Mozart of sales? This post provides an 8-step framework to help build a successful sales strategy. 

### Definition

A Sales Cadence is a series of touch points that are designed to deepen engagement with prospects to achieve a specific goal. This could be anything from scheduling a phone call to generating positive responses.

No matter how cold your prospects may be, they will still need multiple nudges and touches throughout the sales process to keep the deal moving.

A sales cadence is a structured framework that ensures each prospect receives the right nudge/touch at just the right moment. A cadence can include emails, phone calls, text messages, and social media.

### The Framework for Building an Effective Sales Cadence

Here's a guideline of 8 steps on how to create a sales cadence that delivers results. The framework is broken down into three parts.

**Research** - Understanding your prospects is the foundation of a well-designed cadence. We guide you through the initial steps of the process to establish your cadence objective. Next, we will research your prospects to understand what their needs are.

**Planning** - The second part of this process focuses on building your cadence. This section focuses on the details of building a cadence. It includes planning the number of touches and the purpose of each touch.

**Automation** - We explain why you should automate your sales activities and the benefits that it brings.

### 8 Steps on How to Create a Sales Cadence

#### 1. Define your Cadence Objective

All it takes is the question What is the most practical goal you can achieve with this cadence?

Do you want prospects to schedule a demo or sign them up for a free trial of the product? Do they need to respond to a survey or should they call you to qualify? 

Your cadence should aim to be the next step that is least intrusive and moves prospects closer to the end goal (such as scheduling a demo).

Most people set unrealistic goals when they start to build their sales pipeline.

They want to use the cadence to close deals right away. Or, schedule a call to a prospect who doesn't know much about them.

Understanding that a cadence is not enough to close a deal (unless that is the next step) is key. It can only help your prospects move towards the next stage of the sales process.

This means that your prospect's state (cold or hot) and the problem you solve will determine the next step.

Start with the objective to ensure that you remain on track when designing your communication channels, email copy, call scripts, subject line, and calls-to-action (CTAs), etc.

#### 2. Evaluate the Channels & Resources Available 

There are many communication channels that you can use to reach your prospects as a salesperson. There are many ways to reach out to your prospects, including emails, phone calls, SMS, LinkedIn (social network), and direct mail.

Most people will default to a combination of email and phone calls.

These channels are great for connecting with prospects but they are also highly saturated. It is important to consider other channels. An omnichannel approach is necessary to build a balanced cadence that gets prospects to respond.

How do you determine which channel is best for your prospects?

The most appropriate outreach channel depends on how valuable a prospect is to you/your likely ROI.

The more valuable a prospect is, the more you can spend time on them. It is also more likely that you will have fewer prospects to deal with.

You might be more personal when dealing with an enterprise-grade client. To win the prospect's attention, you might send direct mail with personalized merchandise. Then, follow up with a series of calls, emails, text messages, and social touches.

However, when you have to reach out to prospects with low deal value, such as SMBs for example, you can't help but do so quickly and without much personalization.

A study on how SMBs prefer to be contacted revealed that 79% preferred email over other communication channels.

Email is a must if you are targeting SMB accounts. The email can then be merged with LinkedIn InMail/social touch. These channels are most often used for high-velocity sales models with low Annual Contract Value (ACV).

#### 3. Understanding Your Prospects 

It's important to personalize your communications when you try to strike up a conversation with prospects. Craft messages that are unique to each prospect.

How can you implement compelling personalization effectively? How can you gather useful information about your prospects to help you choose the right triggers for your messaging?

You must thoroughly research your prospects. It is essential to research your prospects to learn about their goals, pain points, and recent achievements. This will allow you to create effective messaging that resonates with them.

Research can be done in two ways.

First, research your prospects and gather information about them. Then, go about creating each email/message.

This method may not be practical when dealing with a large number of prospects.

Batching your research is key to scaling your prospecting efforts. This will allow you to scale your outreach.

Instead of studying each prospect individually, you instead study them as a group. This means you gather the same information/facts about all your prospects and then create a tabulated version of this data. This table will allow you to choose the customization points that will be used in your emails.

Start by selecting small groups of 5-10 prospects. Now, collect 10-15 pieces of information from each group, such as industry and geography. Now, compile the information in a spreadsheet to create a data table.

This table can be used to create personalized email templates that you can send to a variety of prospects. This will greatly reduce the time it takes to compose emails.

#### 3. Describe Your Value Proposition 

Next, identify the fundamental problem you can solve for your prospects to build your sales pipeline.

This can be done by looking at your customers and understanding them. They will tell you why your product is a good fit for your prospects.

Your product is the perfect solution to their needs! These customers love your product because it is the perfect solution to their needs. It meets all of their requirements and provides them with everything they need, making it the best choice for them.

They appreciate your dedication to quality and customer satisfaction, which drives them to buy from you again and again. 

Talk to your customers to do this. To understand the impact that you have had on your customers, run a survey or campaign and compile the results. If possible, quantify your results.

1. *Solved problem x.*
2. *Increased revenue by y.*
3. *Increased productivity with z.*
4. *Attained the desired outcome x, etc.*

This is your ultimate value proposition, the reason your customers purchase from you.

Your value proposition will help you communicate clearly with your prospects. Now you know what resonates with your audience and how to convert them.

#### 5. Evaluate all the Levers of Influence at Your Disposal

Any cadence should be used to persuade prospects to move the deal forward. To *influence* them to take the desired action.

As you build your cadence, think of how you can convince your prospects. What tools are you able to use to get there?

Robert B. Cialdini's seminal book, "Influence", outlines six psychological strategies that will help you become a skilled persuader.

These six techniques - Reciprocation and Commitment and Consistency Social Proof Authority, Liking, and Scarcity – can be used to persuade prospects.

Ask yourself what influence levers you have that can make an impact on your prospects and encourage them to take the next steps.

You can use the Reciprocation technique to provide them with a valuable resource and make them feel obligated.

Do you have social proof that your prospects' customers are happy customers? Or do you have something in common with prospects that could elicit a response?

Find out which tools you can use to get your prospects to move forward.

#### 6. Planning Your Sales Cadences

These steps will help you plan and create a sales strategy.

**Number of Touches** - Begin by determining the number of touches you want to have with your prospects.

To outline your sales strategy, list all resources that you have evaluated in the previous steps. This list should typically include:

The multiple value propositions that you would like to communicate to your prospects.
All the influence levers you want to use. 

Your cadence should be designed to maximize the resources you have to get a response from your prospects. It takes 8-10 touches to get prospects to respond.

Optimize your cadence so that you convey the value propositions, provide a valuable resource and use the urgency technique.

**Channel Used for Each Touch** - Next, plan the communication channel that you will use for each touchpoint.

It will make it easier to generate a response from prospects if you are thoughtful about the channel that is being used.

You could, for example, use a social touch (such as connecting with them via LinkedIn first) to warm up prospects and then refer that familiarity in your next touch of sending an e-mail.

**Purpose of Each Touch** - Every contact you make with prospects should have a clear purpose. Sending an email should clarify what you are trying to accomplish. Or, you can call.

Do you want to build trust with your prospects? Or should they just try your newsletter? Do you want them to understand your value proposition or just to check out your product videos?

Your call-to-action should be aligned with the purpose of the touch/step.

If you are merely trying to get to know your prospects by sending them valuable resources, your CTA can't schedule a demo call. Instead, simply provide the download link and request feedback.

Similar to the previous step, if you want prospects to sign up for your product, address a pain point they can relate to, and then link to your free trial.

**Space out Your Touches** - You need to be able to distinguish between annoying and persistent when you try to start a conversation.

To ensure that you follow up with your prospects promptly, and do not push them away, you will need to carefully space out your messages.

It is a good idea to do 8-10 touches per month.

The first few touches may be quite frequent, but you can gradually reduce the frequency.

For example, you might try to make 2-3 touches in the first 2 weeks. One of these touches could be a social touch. 

#### 7. Copywriting Best Practices

Now that you have done your research and created your cadence, it is time to create your email copy.

Your email copy is one key tool that you have to get prospects to respond to.

A great email will provide value to your audience by using language that is familiar to them and capturing enough attention to get their attention.

How can you create an email that works like magic?

Email copy contains many elements, including subject line, introduction, and value prop. A good email copy makes use of each element to maximize the benefit.

Copy has been covered extensively before, and we won't repeat it here. These are some great resources to help you nail your email copy.

**Subject Line:** Your subject line is what prospects will see first in an email. Make a great first impression to get them to open your email.
**Email Body (Introduction & Value Prop):** Your email copy sets the tone for a successful relationship. It is important to use it well.
**Call-to-Action (CTA):** Your prospect will be guided by a call-to-action at the end of your mail to take the desired action. Make it compelling enough to get them to take the next step.
**Cold Email Signature:** A thoughtful signature in a cold email will make a lasting impression on your prospects. Make sure you do it well.

#### 8. Use Sales Engagement Tools

The scale of operations is one of the greatest obstacles to successfully implementing sales cadences.

Let's say, for example, you want to reach 50 prospects each day. This is approximately 1000 prospects per month.

If your sales cadence is 10 touches, then it's approximately 10k touches per month.

It's almost impossible to track each prospect's progress when you have so many data points. This is why automation is necessary.

**Reduce time. Increase productivity.**  It can be very time-consuming to keep track of open, bounces, or replies.

Automating your cadence automatically makes your life easier. Prospects only get notified when they respond. Automating your cadence takes out all the work involved.

This allows you to save time and concentrate on important tasks, such as building relationships that are relevant to the interested sales leads.

**Get Actionable Insights from Data.** Automation offers many benefits, including the ability to use data to improve efficiency and tweak your processes.

Automation allows you to track engagement metrics for every cadence, which shows how well prospects are engaging with that cadence.

This will allow you to collect sufficient data about your sales cadences and then experiment with them to find out what works. You can then replicate this process across all your prospects.

### Summary

Like any technology, a sales cadence is a powerful tool. It all depends on how you use it. Sales reps need to know how to create a sales cadence. It can be a lifesaver when used properly by a salesperson.

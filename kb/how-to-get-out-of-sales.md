Here are some tips on how to get out of sales and find a new path: Evaluate your skillset When considering a career change, it's important to think about what skills you have to offer.

### Common Career Changes for Salespeople

Changes in career paths, whether salespeople or not, are quite common these days. They are more common than the other -- staying in the same company for 50 years and/or being in the same job for 50 years.

Studies show that the average person switches jobs 12 times in their professional career. It is not unusual to work in one job for five years or less before switching to another.

What is the answer? What makes people more likely to venture out of their comfort zone and try something new?

#### Top Reasons People Change Their Sales Careers

* Higher salaries
* More flexibility
* Better work-life balance
* Less stress
* Relocation
* Better benefits

Are any of these motivating factors enough to make you want to leave your current sales role?

LinkedIn was founded in 2014 to help people understand the career paths they choose and the changes that drive them. They analyzed millions of LinkedIn profiles to identify trends that might interest you, especially if you are involved in sales.

Even though new trends have passed, many of these findings are still relevant today.

#### The Most Common Paths for Former Salespeople

There are many options available if you don't feel like sticking with the sales cycle (prospecting and qualifying, closing, etc.).

Some people are born to be salespeople. Others learn to love the chase and master their productivity so they can close more deals.

Others are less enthusiastic about the process. It's a constant grind of relationship-building and deal-making. It can be difficult to change your career path because many companies don’t offer the same growth opportunities as other positions.

The LinkedIn study revealed that salespeople *who* made the transition out tended to follow one of these six career paths.

1. Marketing Specialist
2. Corporate Strategist
3. Consultant
4. Operations Manager
5. Business owner
6. Retail Salesperson

#### Other Interesting Sales Career Trends

LinkedIn members who were in the military had the most interesting career transitions, going into everything from corporate strategy to business ownership. There were also many transition options for "program analyst" and "community outreach coordinator," which are both great careers.

Another trend that was evident in the data was that specialists tend to be stuck in their fields.

Paralegals, web developers, and physicians tended to stay in their respective fields when they transitioned to other roles, such as software engineers, lawyers, and professors at universities. This means that if you are in a highly specialized field, it is unlikely that you will be changing careers anytime soon.

This is the reason for the rising trend of generalization. Generalists are still valued for their soft people skills in areas such as leadership, management, and strategy. It's easier to be relevant in multiple fields and job roles and transitions.

### Creating a Seamless Transition

Maybe you have decided that sales is not the right fit. Next, you need to create a plan for transitioning into a new field.

#### Step #1: Identifying the reason.

Write down all the reasons you don't love your job and why you want to change careers. This is essential to ensure that you don't move into a new job with the same qualities you hated in your previous job.

#### Step #2: Transferable skills audit.

To discover the skills and attributes you can bring to a new job, ask the following questions:

* Why did I choose to go into sales?
* What sales skills have made me a good salesperson?
* What is the most enjoyable part of my job? What about the least?
* What would your co-workers say about my work style? What are my strengths/weaknesses?

#### Step #3: Find job roles that match your skills.

#### Step #4: Job search.

For a better job search, you can use multiple online job platforms. Journals and newspapers are also good sources of information. You can find relevant information about companies and positions by using several online job portals.

It is important to consider the salary, career growth opportunities, as well as the minimum qualifications required for the job that you are interested in.

#### Step #5: Update your resume and cover letter.

Your resume and cover letter should be matched with the transferable skills audit you have completed. 

### Why Salespeople Can Easily Leap Into Other Careers

Since 2014, the job market has experienced many changes and ups. There are more job opportunities now than there are people who are unemployed, or more specifically, *qualified, unemployed* people.

Soft skills are also highly sought after, despite the high number of technical job openings. More companies are prioritizing soft skills among their new hires to improve communication, collaboration, and leadership as well as time management.

High-demand jobs in customer success, sales, and marketing are still available. Customers' experience is a key component of anyone trying to drive traffic, interest, and conversions online. The fifth most promising job in 2018 was Sales Director.

These professionals are also increasingly concerned that AI and automation may soon make their jobs obsolete. Skillsets are constantly being updated and tested to keep up with technological advances.

Salespeople aren't restricted to one career, no matter how they adapt to changes. Studies show that salespeople with quota-carrying and sales experience will be the most effective workers in the future.

This can be attributed to a few factors: entrepreneurial spirit, relationship-driven mentality, and soft skill development. Salespeople are known for being go-getters. They create a personal brand, set goals, chase them, and then motivate themselves to reach them.

They are often great CEOs because of this.

Salespeople must improve their communication and teamwork skills to be successful from a relationship perspective. The best salespeople can maintain order and stability throughout the entire sales process. Reps must stay focused and organized when there are so many steps and moving parts.

These skills can be applied to a variety of career paths. This is especially true when you consider the gig economy and the ease with which you can obtain an online education.

Many online degrees can be taken, from project management to computer science. Trailhead, a great resource for Salesforce sales professionals, is another great resource.

#### What is sales burnout?

Burnout is a condition that causes emotional, physical, or mental fatigue. It is usually caused by prolonged and intense stress. Overwork and stress can lead to burnout in sales positions. It occurs when you feel frustrated by high-pressure sales quotas and are unable to meet constant demands.

#### Is it time to quit your sales job?

There are two things you can look out for when you're ready to quit your sales job. The first is being underpaid or having to take a pay cut. This is especially true if you have tried and negotiated your salary with your company.

If you don't see career growth, you will soon feel unhappy. If your job ambitions change, and your employer is going through a cultural transition that you are concerned about, it could be a sign that the changes will be negative. This could be a great time to explore other career options and avenues.

### Summary

Perhaps you've decided that sales is not for you and are looking for a way how to get out of sales and do something you love. It's time for you to make a change if you feel trapped in your current job. Next, step #1 is to create a game plan for transitioning into a new field.

### Definition

Accounts receivable designate amounts of money owed to a company. These amounts should be received as payments for goods or services that the company provided to parties that still haven’t paid for them. Accounts receivable are the opposite of [accounts payable](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-accounts-payable).

Hence, ARs fall into the **assets** category. They’re long-term planned inflows that the company plans to charge for during a given financial period.

### How Accounts Receivable Work

ARs are recorded in the assets section of a company’s balance sheet. If the AR balance increases, it’s an indicator that the company is giving too many of its goods and services on credit, which may result in its inability to pay off some of its obligations on time. 

In the opposite case, if the AR balance of a company is low, it indicates it’s very rigid and isn’t giving its customers too much leeway for making payments — something that may have a negative effect on client relationships.

ARs are recorded in a special accounts receivable sub-ledger of the general ledger.

Usually, ARs account for a form of credit given out by businesses to customers who cannot immediately pay for goods or services. The business determines a time period — a term — for the due payment. Before the term passes, the customer/client is supposed to pay off what they owe to the business. Most commonly, ARs rely on invoices issued to customers with the product or service, which they’re supposed to pay by the time the term expires.

If the customer doesn’t pay the due amount after the expiration of the term, the company may charge them additional late fees or employ a collection agency to collect the due debt. To avoid such situations that may turn unpleasant for the parties involved, it’s best for companies to give out products and services on credit only to those customers that can be trusted to pay for them before the term expires. This means that issuing such credits constitutes a calculated risk in itself — one that must be taken into account by the company beforehand.

### Procedure

The process of dealing with accounts receivable will take companies through the following stages:

* **Issuing the bill** — The company sends an invoice together with the goods or services it gives to its customers, usually indicating the term by the ending of which payment should be done.
* **Registering the records** — The company then registers the due amount in the AR sub-ledger as an asset, to be charged by the expiration of the term.
* **Charging** — The final step is the customer’s payment, preferably before the term ends. In the worst case, if payment doesn’t happen before the term expires, the company may resort to calling in a collection agency.

### Summary

Аccounts receivable (ARs) indicate amounts that a business is owed by parties to which it supplied products or services. Businesses usually issue invoices to these parties, which they’re expected to pay before the expiration of a designated time period known as a term.

The total of all these amounts can be found in the assets section of the AR balance sheet. Increases or decreases in a company’s AR balance reveal how much of its products and services it gives out as a credit to customers.

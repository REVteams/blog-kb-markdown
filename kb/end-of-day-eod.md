# What is End of Day (EOD)?

## The ever more dynamic atmosphere in which modern businesses operate creates a constant need for activities to be finished at faster paces.

Across different business sectors, this need has sprung a number of different mechanisms and concepts that aim to speed up daily processes and workloads. One such concept is known as end of day, or EOD for short.

#### Definition

The term end of day (EOD) is used by businesses to refer to the time when the working day ends, typically as a deadline for finishing tasks given to employees by their superiors. In many cases, EOD as a deadline refers to the time of day when employees leave their posts and go home — for instance, in the case of 9–5 jobs, this would be 17:00. The term can also refer to the end of the entire day and the moment the next workday starts, and other specific meanings the wider concept of an end of a business day can assume.

#### End of Day and Close of Business

Different businesses can use different terms to express the same or similar meaning as that of EOD. Some of these terms include end of business (EOB), close of play (COP), end of play (EOP), and most notably close of business (COB) which is used more often than all of the above.

Much like EOD, businesses use COB to designate the end of the working day, usually as a deadline for employees’ projects. In essence, the main difference between the two is a matter of nuance. While the concept of COB stresses the moment a business closes its doors to trade (commonly 17:00), an EOD deadline doesn’t necessarily mean that an activity should be finished at the very moment the business closes (though it sometimes does). In any case, terms such as EOD, COB, COP, and EOB are used interchangeably more often than not, and whenever a business does make a difference between these, it’s usually a matter of smaller details rather than a core dissimilarity.

#### How Businesses Use EOD

In business practice, the term EOD is mostly used by superiors when giving their employees deadlines. For example, it’s common for employers, when communicating with their employees, to use phrases such as “Please send the report to me by EOD today” and “We should have the results by EOD on Tuesday”.

However, the exact meaning of EOD — that is, the exact time of day by which employers expect a particular activity to be finished — can sometimes remain unclear. This is particularly the case when employers don’t openly inform the whole team working for a business (and especially new hires) exactly what time they have in mind when they use the term EOD.

For different businesses, EOD can be used to refer to different times of the day, and some are more flexible with this definition than others. When an employer wants an employee to complete an activity by EOD on a particular day, this commonly means that they should do it before the business closes for the day. In other cases, an EOD deadline can mean that employees have time to complete an activity before the end of the day itself (midnight), or even before the beginning of the next workday — so, if a business’s workday begins at 9 a.m., for instance, employers that want something done by EOD may not actually expect results until the morning after at 9 a.m.

Even when EOD clearly refers to the exact time the business closes, sometimes employers can expect to see results sometime before the actual closure — and some can even expect them right after closing the business. In fact, it’s not uncommon for employees to stay to work overtime when they’re expected to finish a particular task by EOD on the same day.

This goes to show that, because the meaning of EOD isn’t exactly standardized across companies and is often a matter of personal interpretation by employers, it can often be misunderstood by employees who may come up with their own personal interpretation of it. In the worst case, such a scenario can result in a discrepancy between the time an employee thinks they should finish their task and the actual time the employer had in mind. Further confusion can also arise in environments with employees working in different time zones.

Therefore, openly communicating about what EOD means within the inner circle of a particular company is crucial. EOD usage should not be taken lightly, nor should employers take for granted that every employee will always be on the same page with them if they hear the term without previous specification regarding its exact meaning.

Alternatively, an employer can specify a concrete time in addition to setting an EOD deadline — for example, they could say “Please have the papers on my desk no later than EOD at 5 p.m. today”, or “The task should be finished by EOD today so that we can see the results at the beginning of the workday tomorrow”. For companies with employees working in different time zones, phrases that specify the exact time zone such as “We need this done by 5 p.m. EDT” are ideal. In fact, omitting the term EOD and using only specific time designators when communicating is also an option for employers aiming to avoid confusion altogether.

#### Summary

End of day (EOD) is a term that refers to the time of day when businesses stop working, commonly as a deadline given to employees by their employers. An EOD deadline often means that employees should finish a task by the time the business closes, though it isn’t always so.

Other similar terms are sometimes used interchangeably with EOD, such as end of business (EOB), close of play (COP), end of play (EOP), and close of business (COB). While all these terms refer to the same thing most of the time, there can be some differences in nuance and details.

Different businesses can use the term EOD with somewhat different ideas of what exact time of the day it refers to as a deadline. If employers don’t specify the exact time of day they refer to when they use the term EOD, their employees risk misunderstanding it and creating a discrepancy between expected and real delivery times. The concept of EOD can also become more complicated in companies with employees in different time zones. Because of this, the employers should take the time to specify the exact time of EOD to their employees, and even add time zone-specific phrases to their communication whenever necessary.

# What is Closed Won

## When businesses create their sales strategies, they often use a particular method of visualizing their sales, known as the sales funnel.

This funnel is used to guide businesses through the entire sales procedure, from the very first phase of acquiring leads and attempting to gain their interest for the products or services they’re selling, to the final step of concluding a sale.

As the sales funnel helps businesses understand each sales phase, it also helps them determine the final outcome of each sale — that is, whether they’ve successfully concluded a sale or not. One such outcome, used largely by customer relationship management systems, is called closed won.

#### Definition

Closed won is the status of a sales opportunity where a business has closed a deal with a prospect or lead, who is now considered a customer. In other words, it’s the final moment of the sales funnel, indicating that a business has closed a product or service sale, and concluded a deal with the individual or organization doing the purchase.

Specific situations that can make a business declare a closed won sale include interactions such as finalizing a product or service order, signing a subscription contract, or converting a prospect into a customer.

#### Closed Won as a CRM Function

The term closed won is mainly used to designate a function in customer relationship management systems, or CRMs, the most famous among these being Salesforce. When applying the closed won function on a sale in a CRM, businesses categorize this sale as successfully closed and then usually proceed to take care of the next sale on their list.

In CRM systems as well as in general usage, a situation or function designating the opposite of closed won is called closed lost. Applying the closed lost function means that the business closes a sale attempt by concluding that it cannot effectively sell the product or service in question to a potential customer. The potential of selling in this situation is estimated to be at 0%, and this customer is considered lost.

#### The Importance of the Closed Won Function

As part of the sales funnel, closed won is the final and most desirable stage of each sales process, designating it has been 100% successful. This outcome is something every business strives to achieve — even though, in reality, less than half of the attempted sales will result in a closed won status for most companies.

The closed won function is also crucial to the CRM systems that use it. When businesses mark a sale as closed won in a CRM such as Salesforce, all the details of this sale — such as its value and the amount of time it took the business to successfully close it — are written down in the annual closed won database where they’re made easily accessible for reference.

CRMs use the data stored in the closed won database to help companies improve their sales strategies by using multiple functionalities, usually in the form of charts. These can display several parameters that a company’s sales team might find useful, such as what particular salesperson managed to obtain the highest amount of closed won sales, the target audience that’s most likely to buy a product or service from the company, and what sales approaches have proven to be the most useful for generating closed won outcomes.

Applying the closed won status on a sale in a CRM system means that it finally passed through the entire [sales pipeline](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/sales-pipeline-fundamental-stages). Eliminating the sale from this pipeline informs the company’s salespersons that they can focus on other, unconcluded sales, speeding up the business’s sales and growth process in general.

The closed won CRM function is a great feature for companies that value a transparent approach when demonstrating the performance of its sales team in general, as well as that of each individual salesperson within this team. It also gives companies an invaluable insight into the success of each sales strategy they’ve been using. Companies can then use this knowledge to improve their future strategies wherever possible, keep those sales approaches that actually work, and eliminate practices that don’t usually result in closed won sales.

#### Summary

The term closed won is used to describe a situation where a business has managed to close a sale with an individual or organization that at that point becomes its customer. It designates the final stage of the sales funnel, resulting in a successful sale of a product or service - signing a subscription agreement or converting a lead into a customer.

Except for serving as a general indicator that designates a successfully closed sale by companies, closed won is also a function in CRM systems, where it’s used most regularly. The opposite function of closed won in a CRM system, designating that a customer has a 0% likelihood of buying a product or service, is called closed lost.

Closed won is the most desirable outcome of the sales process for every business. It is also a crucial function of the CRM systems that use it. Marking a sale as closed won in a CRM system removes it from the company’s sales pipeline, allowing its sales team to move on to new potential sales. Each closed won sale is also stored in the CRMs closed won database, which uses this data to show companies how successful their sales team was, which sales approaches they used worked best, and how they can improve their overall sales strategy in the future.

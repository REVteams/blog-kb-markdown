SaaS (Software as a service) is a model for software distribution in which a third-party provider hosts the applications and makes them accessible to customers via the Internet. SaaS customers are mainly businesses. They may not always be end-users of the applications.

Google is a typical example of a SaaS provider. Every day, we use Google Docs and Google Drive. Google Analytics is used by almost all businesses to track their work. These apps are SaaS products.

Business customers don't need to install the app on their computers. Instead, they can use the application. Instead, they can access the app's copy via the internet from any device, desktop or mobile.

The source code is the same for all users. New features will be made available to all customers. Depending on the service contract, each module's data can be stored locally or in a cloud.

**Cost-effective.** SaaS products offer a great alternative to merchants who want to install and run applications on their own systems. They can also save on hardware purchase, maintenance, bug fixing, and other costs. This saves a lot of time and effort on support and installation.

**Flexible payment options.** Customers can subscribe to SaaS products on a monthly, yearly, or any other basis than spending one-time payments. Merchant customers will be able to better manage their operations by moving to scheduled operating costs. This will allow them to budget more effectively. Users can also stop SaaS subscriptions at any time they wish to save these recurring costs.

**Auto-updates are available.** SaaS products also have the advantage of being able to be updated automatically and centrally via app providers. This update will not impact the business customers' operations in any way. Auto-update and managing pathways help to reduce the time and resources required by the in-house IT department for business users.

# What is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)?

## Over the past few decades, technological advances in the field of information technology have created many possibilities for internet users — individuals and organizations alike.

Businesses, in particular, are increasingly switching to using [cloud hosting](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-cloud-hosting) services through which they can host their computer resources on a [cloud server](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/cloud-server) powered by a third-party cloud provider as an alternative to the more traditional on-premise hosting. One way to use cloud hosting is by subscribing to an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model.

#### Definition

Infrastructure as a service — IaaS for short — is one of three ways cloud providers offer cloud hosting for the computer systems of their [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) (or users) in a virtualized environment. Through the IaaS model, providers manage the [IT infrastructure](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-it-infrastructure) (servers, storage, network resources, and virtualization in particular) of the clients that subscribe to their services, by deploying virtual machines that these clients can access online.

#### Background

IaaS is one of three main ways of using cloud hosting. Cloud hosting solutions have appeared in the past couple of decades as an alternative to the more traditional method of on-premise hosting, wherein businesses host their whole IT infrastructure complete with hardware, operating systems, and applications on their own computers and usually installed and running at the physical premise where the business is situated (hence the name).

With this in mind, to run enterprise-level apps on-premises, business users need to have quality hardware, [middleware](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-middleware/), operating systems, and the app’s software itself. This usually costs a lot, and on top of that, building and running such a demanding stack remains the full responsibility of the business.

The main advantage of on-premise hosting was that businesses were in full control of their infrastructure, which used to be a regulatory requirement as a sign of business practice. However, much has changed since then, and nowadays cloud-hosting is as valid an option as on-premises because it managed to prove that businesses don’t have to own their IT resources to be able to make productive and secure use of them.

Cloud hosting helps businesses by removing the burden of IT management and support they’d have to take on if they used on-premise hosting. By having some or all of their resources hosted on cloud servers, businesses are left with very little responsibility in terms of buying, deploying, and configuring infrastructure as well, having outsourced these to their cloud providers.

#### IaaS vs. SaaS vs. PaaS

IaaS is one of the three main cloud hosting models, the other two being platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). The difference between the three consists in the amount of responsibility for the infrastructure stack they shift from the business to the cloud host.

With the IaaS model, the cloud hosting provider offers businesses the lowest amount of computing resources as a service, including servers, storage, networking, and virtualization. This means that through IaaS, the provider is only responsible for the physical infrastructure, the hypervisor layer, and security features (identity and access management). Businesses access this cloud-hosted infrastructure online but are still left with the bulk of the responsibilities for themselves, including installing their own operating systems, software applications, and so on.

The platform as a service (PaaS) model, in turn, provides all the infrastructure that its IaaS counterpart does and adds to it by having providers host additional resources including operating systems, middleware, as well as other runtimes, too. In this model, providers have more responsibility than with IaaS, because besides managing the hardware and infrastructure, they’re also tasked with installing, configuring, and updating these additional resources. Businesses are left with the responsibility to focus on deploying and managing their own [data](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-data) and apps, as everything else is taken care of by their cloud providers.

Lastly, the software as a service (SaaS) is the most pervasive option of the three. Besides giving businesses access to everything the PaaS model does, SaaS also lets them access a complete app and its data through the cloud hosting service. This means that the cloud service provider is responsible for hosting the entire hardware and software stack, making them accessible to the host’s clients online. The SaaS model leaves virtually all management responsibility in the hands of providers, as they’re the ones who buy, install, configure, and upgrade hardware and software resources alike. Users just need to log in to use the SaaS they’ve subscribed to, with the integrity and security of the app’s data being their sole responsibility.

#### How Does IaaS Work?

The IaaS model, much like its other two cloud hosting counterparts, is most commonly provided to users by a cloud host. This host is usually a third-party cloud provider specialized in IaaS and selling it as a service based on subscriptions by end-users, which can be individuals and organizations alike. As an alternative to providers, users — particularly businesses — can decide to deploy a [private cloud](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-private-cloud) environment instead, in which case they provide their own infrastructure services.

With the infrastructure they provide, IaaS cloud hosts can also supply users with a variety of services related to the infrastructural resources they use. Such services can include backup, recovery, log access, monitoring, and more. Providing such services automates the working process even further for the users.

In most cases, IaaS infrastructure is accessible to users through the internet, though it can be used with any kind of [WAN](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/what-is-a-wan-wide-area-network.html) network, such as [carrier clouds](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/carrier-cloud/48521), for instance. IaaS users log into their cloud infrastructure platform to install the remaining resources of their stack — application software, operating systems, middleware, and runtime environments. This is done through [virtual machines](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine) — software replacements for physical computers that run on cloud servers — on which users run operating systems and apps.

#### Why Businesses Use the IaaS Model

In organizational (and notably business) usage, IaaS cloud hosting is considered a favorable solution characterized by increased workload speed, ease of use, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.

When compared to on-premise hosting, businesses and other organizations that opt for the IaaS model save money and efforts they’d otherwise have to spend on buying, managing, and providing support for on-premise infrastructure. Through the IaaS model, businesses only pay for renting the cloud infrastructure and don’t have to worry about its maintenance at all, since that’s the responsibility of their IaaS cloud providers.

Among the cloud hosting models, IaaS is best suited for temporary and experimental workloads — or for any type of workload that’s prone to sudden, unexpected changes. This commonly includes testing new applications, for instance, which is cheapest to do through IaaS cloud services. After the business runs all the tests and does all the improvements necessary during the pre-launch stage of an app, it may decide to either move it from the provider’s IaaS environment to its own on-premise deployment or go for a more long-term IaaS subscription for the app to slash costs if it deems this kind of arrangement saves more money on hosting.

When it comes to charging, clients usually pay for IaaS services per user, often on a weekly or monthly basis. In some cases, however, IaaS providers charge through a [pay-as-you-go](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pay-as-you-go) system, wherein they charge their clients for the specific amount of space they take up on their cloud servers. This can be very convenient for businesses that don’t want to spend extra money on services they won’t use.

If for some reason a business is prevented from hosting its IT resources with a provider, it can decide to host its own IaaS through a private cloud on its own premises. In such cases, however, the business will be incurring the costs associated with on-premise hosting, which could easily be avoided by subscribing to the services of IaaS cloud providers instead.

#### Downsides

While the IaaS model has many benefits, certain businesses may consider it to be more harmful than good for them. One of the reasons for this is the pay-as-you-go system itself, which is an advantage to some but less so to others. While it’s meant to charge users for the exact amount of resources they use up, the actual price for each resource can sometimes be a bad surprise to them when they go through their bills. This largely depends on the provider, of course, but it pays for users to do research into how IaaS usage works in order to prevent their providers from charging them for unwanted services.

Another downside of the IaaS model is related to the fact that the infrastructure isn’t owned by the users. Namely, IaaS providers don’t usually disclose the configuration and performance of their infrastructure openly. This renders the process of renting an IaaS infrastructure non-transparent, which makes it harder for users to monitor and manage the systems.

What’s more, with providers using their own servers to host their customers’ software and data, stability concerns can also arise among customers. Namely, how well their workloads will perform — and whether they can remain constantly available to them — depends on how resilient their providers’ service is. In case of server downtime (which can be caused by various unwanted events), internet bottlenecks, and other unforeseen complications, customers may feel the impact of lower accessibility to their own workloads which they pay to have hosted by the providers.

Having multiple users hosted on the same cloud server by an IaaS provider can also cause performance drops. Users that take up too much bandwidth, disk input and output, CPU, and other resources can reduce the performance of the workloads of their neighboring users paying for the same infrastructure.

#### Summary

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a model through which providers offer cloud hosting for the computer systems of users in a virtualized environment. Through the IaaS model, providers manage the IT infrastructure of users by deploying virtual machines that users can access online.

Cloud hosting has appeared in the past couple of decades as an alternative to the more traditional method of on-premise hosting, through which businesses host their whole IT infrastructure on their own computers. Because of the costs associated with on-premise hosting, and the fact it’s no longer a regulatory requirement, more and more businesses are switching to cloud hosting.

IaaS is one of three main cloud hosting models, the other two being platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). Between the three, IaaS leaves the lowest amount of responsibility with providers who only supply users with basic infrastructure including servers, storage, networking, and virtualization. Users of the IaaS model are left with responsibilities including installing operating systems, software applications, and so on.

IaaS services are most commonly provided by cloud hosts, though in some cases businesses may decide to host their own infrastructure by deploying private cloud environments. IaaS providers also offer their users supplementary services such as backup, recovery, monitoring, and more.

IaaS users access their infrastructure through the internet or another type of WAN. When they log into the infrastructure, they install the remaining resources of their stack through virtual machines.

Businesses often favor the IaaS model because of its speed, ease of use, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. However, besides its many benefits, the IaaS model also has some downsides, notably related to how providers usually charge for it, the non-transparency of the configuration and performance of the providers’ infrastructure, and stability issues caused by third-party resource hosting.

There are different kinds of [accounts](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-account), divided on different bases. Accounts payable, or APs, are one specific type of account that is related to the business’ planned expenses. 

### Definition

Accounts payable are defined as an obligation of a business to pay off due debts to parties they’re dealing with within a short timespan. These usually include goods suppliers, sellers, creditors, and other entities that the business might be indebted to. 

In this sense, accounts payable are the opposite of [accounts receivable](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-accounts-receivable).

The term **accounts payable** is also used for a designated department within a company, charged with paying off debts.

By account nature, APs are considered **liabilities** — that is, long-term planned outflows to be paid during a predetermined financial period.

### How Accounts Payable Work

A business’s AP balance can be found in the liabilities section of its balance sheet. If the sheet records an increase in AP, it’s a clear indicator that the business indebts itself or takes products and services on credit more than it does payments for the given time period.

The short time period in which the accounts payable debt must be paid off indicates the time before the non-payment is considered a default. Defaulting carries certain repercussions, which is why APs are such an important part of a business’s work and they often require their own departments.

AP’s are recorded into their own special subledger of the general ledger. 

### Uses

Businesses can use APs and AP departments to treat due payments for:

* **Bills** — Regular invoices that await payment are common AP’s for businesses.
* **Debts** — For any business party to which a company owes a payment, the account payable balance is updated.
* **Credits** — Whenever a company takes out a loan or a credit, they register it, and the time in which they have to pay it off, as an AP. 
* **Purchases from sellers** — A company’s purchase orders can also be handled by its AP department, which often has to put down the amounts owed to individual vendors in the AP sub-ledger.
* **Internal payments** — Company expenses such as employee salaries and taxes to be paid are another category that can be considered as accounts payable.
* **Company travel costs** — AP departments of companies whose employees travel as part of their work usually make reservations for transport and accommodation. The costs of these reservations are calculated into the company’s accounts payable balance.
* And more.

### Procedure

Accounts payable records are a process in themselves. From opening and closing an AP, their departments go through the following stages:

* **Getting the bill** — At first, the company receives the invoice for the goods/services it purchased or the credits it took.
* **Going through bill details** — The bill must include official details such as the name of the seller/creditor, date issued, authorization, and more.
* **Registering the records** — The company must update the AP sub-ledger with the bill’s details, and the foreseen liabilities are written down in the balance sheet.
* **Paying** — Finally, before the foreseen short period is up, the company must make the due payments to avoid defaulting.

### Summary

Аccounts payable (APs) designate amounts that a business owes to another party, usually in the form of due payments for goods/services, or debts of any kind. 

The AP balance sheet, in its liabilities section, shows the totality of all of these payments that a company is due to pay off to vendors or creditors.

# What is Lead Scoring?

## For most businesses, generating leads is a key process at the very first stages of marketing strategy implementation.

This seems logical because for them to be able to sell to their future customers, they need to get them interested in the products or services they’re selling first.

However, while serving as the basis of future marketing and sales operations, [lead generation](https://rev.team/kb/lead-generation) itself doesn’t guarantee that each one of the generated leads will make a purchase and [convert](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) to a paying customer. There are different tools that can help businesses get an idea of how likely their [leads](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-lead) are to buy a product or service from them, and one of these tools is known as lead scoring.

#### Definition

Lead scoring is a process through which businesses give values — or scores, as the name suggests — to the leads they have previously generated. These values are, in most cases, made up of numeric points, and they’re designed to help businesses rank their leads based on several factors, such as how much personal information each lead has shared with the business, how often they visit its site, how [engaged](https://rev.team/kb/engagement) they are with the business’s brand, and so on.

#### The Importance of Lead Scoring

The main point of this type of ranking is to give businesses insights into the value each lead has to their brands, which, in turn, helps the different teams within a business (marketing, sales, and others) decide which exact leads they’ll try to engage first in order of priority. Leads with higher scores will usually be more likely to be approached by sales and marketing teams, as they consider these leads have a higher chance of converting into paying customers.

While lead scoring doesn’t provide a 100% accurate depiction of what exact leads will convert, the possibility of automating the scores saves marketing and sales teams precious time they can then use to focus on more productive efforts. What’s more, with the latest advancements in AI technology and machine learning, the assumptions that automatized lead scoring makes are constantly getting better at finding patterns based on lead attributes that are truly indicative of the extent to which each lead is likely to convert to a paying customer.

#### Using a Data-Driven Approach to Lead Scoring

The approach to lead scoring is different from business to business, but in most cases, it includes analyzing [data](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-data) that each of them generated from previous leads. This is done by looking at all the leads that actually converted to paying customers in the past and trying to figure out what they all have in common. From there on, businesses compare these to those leads that failed to convert, in an attempt to come up with patterns and attributes that can be assigned to both categories. With these insights in mind, salespersons and marketers can then decide what exact attributes they should measure during lead scoring, depending on the extent to which each of these attributes is likely to be associated with the lead’s likelihood to convert.

There are several different data-driven lead scoring models that businesses can use to make sure that the values they assign to their leads are truly indicative of how compatible each of their leads is with the products or services these businesses sell. Some of these models include:

### Demographics Model

One of the most common practices during lead scoring is to assign values to each lead depending on the [demographic](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-are-demographics-and-how-are-they-used-38513) they belong to. This is particularly the case for businesses whose products and/or services are meant to be sold to a smaller demographic. These businesses usually ask demographic questions (age, gender, location, and so on) to their leads, commonly through their websites, and then use the information they gather in this way to assign scores to their leads. From there on, they inform their sales and marketing teams they should focus on those leads that rank higher on the demographic score list.

### Business Information Model

This is another common lead scoring model, specifically used by [B2B](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2b) businesses that sell to other businesses. This model uses [firmographics](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-firmographics) (which are essentially demographics for businesses) to gather information on the preferences of each one of their business leads, such as their size, the industry they operate in, what their target market is, and so on. According to this information, these target businesses are then ranked to determine how well they fit into the profile of the B2B businesses using this lead scoring model.

### Website Engagement Model

This model relies on analyzing the online interactions of each lead with the businesses’ websites. Here, businesses connect the conversion rates of leads to their behavior with their websites, including parameters such as the materials they download, the pages they visit, their overall browsing time, and so on. This behavior (and changes in it) can be very indicative of the likeliness of each lead to convert.

### Email Engagement Model

Similarly to website engagement, the email engagement model measures the conversion rate of past leads in the context of their behavior towards the emails they receive from a business. How often they respond to these emails, whether they respond at all, how they react to [email marketing campaigns](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/glossary/email-campaign/), and other similar factors can be taken into consideration by a business when assigning scores to each lead through this model.

### Social Engagement Model

Much like the previous two, this model also focuses on the leads’ online activity, with the difference being that it’s specifically used by businesses whose target audience is active on social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and so on. By using this model, businesses assign scores to their leads depending on how often they interact with their social media pages, how many times they like and share posts, and other similar profile interactions through which the likeliness of purchase intent can be assumed.

### Spam Detection Model

Some businesses use this model to subtract points from the score of leads whose behavior can be considered spammy during their online interactions. For instance, if a lead doesn’t capitalize the initial letter of their name while filling out a form, if they fail a [Captcha](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/what-is-captcha/) challenge, or if they submit answers to questions by typing several letters that are next to each other on the keyboard, businesses can lower their score as potential spammers.

#### Summary

Lead scoring is the process of businesses giving values (or scores) to their leads, usually by assigning them numeric points. These scores are designed to help businesses rank their leads based on several factors, related to how engaged they are with the brand, how much personal information they’ve shared, how often they visit the business’s website, and more.

With this type of ranking, businesses aim to determine which leads are most valuable to them, so that their sales and marketing teams can focus on trying to convert them to customers in order of preference. With this in mind, lead scoring estimates are not 100% accurate — however, because of automatization and continuous advances in AI technology, it can speed up lead interaction for salespersons and marketers and allow them to focus on more productive tasks.

Most businesses analyze data from their previously generated leads when doing lead scoring. This is done by analyzing the attributes of old leads that converted as opposed to those of leads that didn’t convert in an attempt to discover patterns that can bring business insights that their salespersons and marketers can use when deciding which leads to prioritize. The data-driven lead scoring models they can use are related to aspects such as demographics, business information, the leads’ website, email, and social network engagement, spam detection, and more.

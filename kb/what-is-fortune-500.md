# What is the Fortune 500?

## Every business aims to grow, make profits through its economic activities, and succeed on the market. The idea of what a successful business is can be understood in several ways.

One prominent example of a sign of success for a business in the U.S. is when it finds itself on the Fortune 500 list.

#### Definition

The Fortune 500 is a list of the most successful 500 companies in the U.S. published by [Fortune](https://fortune.com/fortune500/) magazine. The Fortune 500 list comes out once a year and ranks companies according to the amounts they made in revenue for their last fiscal year.

Public and private companies alike are included in the Fortune 500 list, so long as they publicly disclose the information related to their revenue. In business circles, when companies find themselves on the Fortune 500 list, it’s generally considered a highly prestigious feature for them.

#### Background

From its beginnings in the first half of the 20th century, Fortune magazine quickly earned its position among the most well-known business magazines around the world. While it started as a monthly publication, Fortune magazine has been publishing 14 issues a year since 2018 and has been maintaining a focus on its online presence in the past decades, as well.

Since the 1950s, Fortune has been publishing a list of the top 500 companies in the U.S., including both companies whose equity is publicly traded as well as those that trade their equity privately. Back then, this list was named the Fortune Industrial 500, but this name was later simplified to Fortune 500.

These initial lists included companies from just a small number of sectors — manufacturing, mining, and energy. It was only in the 90s that the Fortune 500 expanded to include the service industry, which immediately accounted for more than half the entries on the list. By now, companies from a much larger number of sectors are also eligible to find themselves on the Fortune 500 list. These sectors include technology, retail, aerospace, defense, chemicals, drug stores, food, healthcare, motor vehicles, hospitality, telecommunications, engineering, construction, transportation, and many more.

Since its inception, the Fortune 500 list has included more than 1,800 companies from the U.S. The companies on the list change every year, with many being removed from it mostly due to causes such as mergers, acquisitions, changes in production output, bankruptcies, recessions, and more.

The Fortune magazine also publishes a smaller Fortune 100 list, as well as a larger Fortune 1000 list, but both of these are referred to far less than the Fortune 500. For the purpose of comparing international companies, the magazine also compiles its Fortune 500 Global list.

#### Companies Eligible For the Fortune 500 List

The Fortune 500 is limited to companies that work within the U.S. and file their [financial statements](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsbegfinstmtguidehtm.html) with U.S. governmental institutions. The following types of companies are excluded from the ranking:

* Companies that don’t operate in the U.S.;
* Private companies not filing their financial statements to the U.S. government;
* U.S.-based companies that are consolidated by foreign parent companies;
* U.S.-based companies that have, for one reason or another, failed to submit their complete financial statements for a minimum of 3 business quarters of the fiscal year for which the Fortune 500 list is being compiled.

Since 2020, the Fortune 500 ranks companies according to the fiscal year earnings they state in their [10-K](https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-k.pdf) annual reports or other similar financial statements submitted to U.S. governmental institutions.

#### How the Fortune 500 List Works

The Fortune 500 uses the fiscal years of companies as a basis for its rankings. With this in mind, each company can have a different fiscal year period for itself, which doesn’t necessarily coincide with the calendar year (although it often does). This means that a company’s end-of-year accounting deadline (which is also the end date for its fourth business quarter of the year) can be set at the end of any month of the year. Companies decide on their fiscal years’ endings themselves, influenced by various factors such as the government’s fiscal year, the end of the season during which they sell most, and so on.

This means that the Fortune 500 list is compiled with a certain time lag in mind, to account for companies having different fiscal year examples. For instance, the 2021 Fortune 500 ranks companies whose fiscal years ended in late 2020 or early 2021.

#### The Importance of the Fortune 500

For companies, being on the Fortune 500 list is a sign of renown and influence. These are considered the most successful companies in the U.S., and the most desirable business partners and providers for high-end clients and partners.

To demonstrate the importance of Fortune 500 companies with an example, it suffices to say that the companies on the 2020 Fortune 500 list make up around [two-thirds](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fortune-announces-2020-fortune-500-list-launches-first-ever-history-of-the-fortune-500-data-analytics-visualization-site-with-partner-qlik-301060615.html) of the U.S. [GDP](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/gdp.htm), which also accounts for almost a fifth of the total global GDP. Put together, these companies employ 29.2 million people across the globe, which is almost 0.4% of the world population.

The Fortune 500 list itself is a particularly important sign for the U.S. economy as a whole. The figures within this list demonstrate the economic power and performance of the top companies in the U.S. which are also among the most successful in the world. What’s more, when compiled after years of overall poor economic performance, the list can also show if the economy has managed to recover in the meantime.

#### Summary

The Fortune 500 is a list compiled by Fortune magazine, which ranks the top 500 companies in the U.S. It’s published yearly and ranks companies based on their revenues for their last fiscal year.

The Fortune magazine started off at the beginning of the 20th century and has been compiling the Fortune 500 list (initially known as the Fortune Industrial 500) since the 50s.

Both public and private companies are eligible for the Fortune 500 list. These companies must have their revenue data publicly available, be based in the U.S., and file their financial statements to U.S. institutions. Companies that don’t operate within the U.S., don’t file their financial statements to U.S. governmental bodies, are consolidated by foreign companies, or have failed to submit their complete financial statements for at least 3 business quarters of their past fiscal year are all excluded from the Fortune 500 rankings.

The Fortune 500 list measures revenues based on the past fiscal year, which can be different for each company and doesn’t necessarily coincide with the calendar year. This means that there’s a lag when ranking Fortune 500 companies, with each year’s list taking into account fiscal years that end at the beginning of the same calendar year or during the later part of the previous year.

Being on the Fortune 500 list is considered a sign of renown, as companies that find themselves on it are among the most influential in the U.S. and the world. The figures on this list are also indicative of the successes of the U.S. economy.

One such tool, particularly useful for businesses that need assistance with reaching out to prospects and potential [buyers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer), is the dialer.

#### Definition

The term dialer (or autodialer) is commonly used to refer to a specific kind of software — and sometimes also electronic devices — whose main purpose is to automatically dial telephone numbers. Automatic dialer software (which is what the term dialer is mostly used for) either plays a pre-recorded voice message or connects the call to a person when it’s answered. 

#### When Are Dialers Used

Companies and other organizations that spend a big part of their work on the phone with their customers, [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client), or other third parties relevant to their business (such as prospects, partners, and so on) are most likely to use dialer software. The main reason these companies prize dialers — despite the fact they’re somewhat unpopular with the audience receiving these automated calls — is because they help them save a lot of time when dialing and free up positions that would otherwise have to be assumed by an employee. 

Different dialer solutions can have different extra features apart from auto-dialing numbers. Some of these features make it likelier to dial numbers of targets that are easier to reach, others eliminate targets that have voicemail, and so on. Many of these extra features use [call analytics](https://www.cxtoday.com/analytics/what-is-call-analytics-interaction-analytics/) to gather data from previous phone contacts, with the aim of making it easier to actually reach the target audience via telephone instead of the call being rejected or ignored.

Dialers are commonly used by sales departments, where call centers often automate their outbound calls in hope of reaching out to as many potential customers as possible. Other sectors where dialers are often used include healthcare, emergencies, and hospitality.

However, besides their obvious advantages of speed and slashing workforce costs, dialers have several downsides as well. The most notable one among these is the fact that they can easily dial countless phone numbers without too much maintenance required, especially when they use voice over internet protocol ([VoIP](https://www.voip-info.org/what-is-voip/)) which can produce hundreds of calls simultaneously. Overusing this feature is more than likely to upset a big part of the target audience dialers are meant to reach and is generally considered intrusive and spammy.

#### How Dialers Work

When it comes to dialer software (which is usually what is meant when the term ‘dialer’ is used nowadays), the prerequisites for using it include:

* **A computer** to install the dialer software on;
* **A person** (usually company employee) to respond to the audience answering the calls;
* **An active telephone** line (which can often be a VoIP line) to make calls through; and
* **A voice modem** that enables computers to play voice messages in case a regular phone line is used. Using VoIP phone lines eliminates the need for voice modems. 

Dialers operate by commanding computers to call particular phone numbers that the dialer software has provided and to stay on the line for a determined period of time while waiting for an answer. They also inform computers how to react to different outcomes of the call — be it a busy line, voicemail message, or someone actually answering.

Picking the numbers to dial is an important, more recent feature of dialers. Before it, dialers would often automatically call randomly generated phone numbers — a practice which is much less likely to result in a favorable outcome. Nowadays, on the other hand, dialer software accesses valid leads, commonly obtained through call analytics and stored in a database, which pinpoint target audiences that are actually likely to pick up. 

As a common practice, dialer software doesn’t wait for targets to answer indefinitely. Instead, businesses using dialers usually predetermine a specific amount of time the dialer will stay on the line before hanging up and passing onto the next number to call. 

Dialers usually hang up when they receive a busy line signal. This is also usually the case when they get voice mail messages — in such situations, some dialers use [speech recognition software](https://www.callrail.com/blog/speech-recognition-software/) to determine they’re actually hearing voicemail and not a real person. 

Dialers register important statistical information derived from the phone calls they make — such as whether a person actually answers the number called or a voicemail is activated, the average call duration, and so on. This kind of information is used when automating future calls.

#### Dialer Types

There are different ways in which dialers can attempt to connect to their targets. The most common ones include:

* **Preview dialing:** Through this dialing type, dialers display call information to the person using them (usually a business employee or call center agent) before they actually dial. This person can then decide whether the dialer should proceed with the call or skip the particular phone number and display call information for the next one.
* **Progressive dialing​:** This type is very similar to preview dialing. The key difference is that in this way, the dialer shows the phone number to the person using it just seconds before it dials, giving them a very short time to decide if they want to interrupt the dialing of the automatic call.
* **Voice broadcasting dialing:** Also known as robocalling, this type of auto-dialing sends a pre-recorded voice message to their target audience. In case the message can’t reach its destination for whatever reason (line busy or call time out), voice broadcasting dialers usually reschedule the call for another time.
* **Predictive dialing:** This type of dialer is arguably the most prized among businesses. Predictive dialers use call statistics they gather for different numbers (such as voicemail activation recurrence, busy signals, and so on) combined with a number of statistical algorithms to decide what numbers to dial, optimizing waiting intervals before calls and saving call agents’ time.
* **Smart predictive dialing:** This is a specific type of predictive dialing that sends a pre-recorded message to the target first, and only passes the call to an agent if the target asks so.
* And more

#### Summary

A dialer, also known as an autodialer, is a term that usually refers to software (and less often to electronic devices) that automatically dials telephone numbers. Dialer software can either play a pre-recorded voice message to the target answering its calls or connect them to a person — usually an employee of the business using the dialer. 

Dialers are commonly used by businesses and other organizations whose work relies a lot on making phone calls. Sectors that use dialers the most include sales, healthcare, emergencies, and hospitality.

Dialers can save businesses a lot of time by automating calls, and it also helps them save on workforce costs. On the other hand, overusing dialers can lead to dissatisfaction by the target audience that can often deem such calls as unsolicited.

To operate, dialer software needs a computer to be installed on, a person (employee) operating it in the background, an active telephone line, and a voice modem in case the line isn’t using VoIP. Common dialer types include preview dialers, progressive dialers, voice broadcasting dialers, predictive dialers, smart predictive dialers, and more.

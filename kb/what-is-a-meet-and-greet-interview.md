### Definition

A meet and greet is when you meet with a hiring manager. However, it is not a job interview. It is more about you introducing yourself to him.

#### What Does a Meet and Greet Mean for a Job?

Informal interviews and candidate meet and greets can help reveal a candidate's true personality. This means that the candidate and manager can meet outside of the office in an environment where they feel comfortable.

#### How to Prepare for a Meet and Greet Interview?

These steps can help you prepare for a meet-and-greet interview:

* Research the company.
* Take into account the structure of the interview.
* Practice potential interview questions.
* Practice in a group setting.
* Make a list of the questions you would like to ask.
* Say thank-you to the team and keep in touch after the interview.

#### How do You Behave at a Meet and Greet?

First, greet them with a "hello" and "hi," and a handshake. Smile and keep your eyes open while speaking calmly to them.

Talk slowly and clearly to them, just as you would to a friend.

### Get Them Out of Interview Mode

Informal interviews and candidate meet and greets can help you break the interview mold and show the candidate's true personality. This means that candidates must be able to meet outside of the controlled office zone and sell the company's vision in an environment that makes them feel like they are comfortable.

Shannon Brayton, Global Marketing and Communications exec, points out, "There is so much you can discover during an hour of dining together... [it] is able to subtly reveal their type of employee."

Brayton will not make a single hire unless she has taken her candidates out to lunch. For candidates, there is more to it than a free lunch. It's a great way to get a glimpse into the company culture and discuss daily tasks with future team members before you sign on the dotted line.

Even if the job doesn't work out, informal meets can be a great way for candidates to develop the self-confidence and magnetic personality that will help them in future interviews. Employers could have a 50% higher chance of retaining their new hires if they put in the extra effort.

Not all informal interview processes are equal. These are three simple rules that will help you get a better understanding of a potential team member without having to deal with awkward conversations or pressure.

#### 1. Begin with a warm-up.

Send each candidate a warm, friendly message by email to start your relationship. It should remind them of the date and the time of the interview, as well as the names of the people they will be meeting. 

You can give the candidate every reason for a great start by giving them the information that they need to understand the role and prepare your questions for them.

#### 2. Invite the right team.

You want the best candidate and not the best interviewer. It all depends on whom you invite for your informal meet and greet.

While you don't have to spend a whole day compiling everyone's DISC profiles for each person, it is important to consider the power dynamics. If all the lunch participants are senior to the candidate, then the candidate will likely feel anxious.

As a result, even a coffee date may feel like a rehearsal.

You want to have a diverse team with people from different backgrounds, departments, seniority, and positions. You want to gain more depth and breadth in their communication (verbally and nonverbally). You'll be able to get a better understanding of the person you work with and how likely they are for success in your office environment.

#### 3. Always follow up.

With automation, there is no excuse to sabotage a job candidate, especially if they have taken the time and met up with you and your colleagues.

You can close the loop on the candidate experience by following up with them after the meet and greet. This will show you appreciate their time and show you value their opinion. This is a great selling point that will be useful when you make an offer.

It's a great way for your employer to keep your brand protected. It's also good karma.

### Summary

So, what is a meet and greet interview? It's simply a way for potential employers to get to know job candidates before inviting them in for an interview. It's a great opportunity for both the employer and the candidate to ask questions and see if there is a good fit.

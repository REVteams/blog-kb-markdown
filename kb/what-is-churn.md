#### Definition

Churn is a term that describes the percentage of a company’s customers that leave or cancel a service or product within a given period of time. Churn is measured in the form of a **churn rate** for that specific time period. Alternative names for churn rate, such as attrition rate or customer churn, can also be used.

#### Which Companies Measure Churn Rate

Churn rate can be measured across different sectors. Most commonly, however, measuring churn rates is important to companies with a contractual customer base — usually, those that function within the [SaaS](https://www.salesforce.com/in/saas/) economy.

These are companies that offer their services as subscriptions for their customers. Therefore, they have a specific interest in determining at what rate they lose paying customers. Common examples of such companies include mobile phone operators and TV and internet providers.

Oftentimes, such companies compete against each other for customers within a particular market. This means that, for customers, it can be easy to switch between these companies, and when they do, they create churn for the service provider they are leaving. For this reason, churn rates are particularly associated with subscription-based industries.

While switching customers usually accounts for churn in the subscription economy, customers that simply stop using a company’s service without moving over to their competitors also add to their churn rate. In any case, companies that mostly rely on subscription contracts to generate revenue are the ones most likely to be measuring churn rates.

#### How to Measure a Business' Health Through Churn

A company can compare its churn rate to its growth rate — that is, how many customers it loses and how many it gains — to gauge the success of its business over a determined period of time.

Simply put, if the company gains more customers than it loses over a certain period, it means that was a period of growth. In the same way, if the opposite was the case — if it lost more customers than it gained — it means it’s had a period of loss. A period of positive growth rate is a period of negative churn rate — and vice versa.

To measure the health of their business, companies can also put their churn rates into perspective by comparing them to other parameters. One example of this practice would be calculating the [CAC](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/customer-acquisition-cost-cac/) for each individual customer that churns. The cost at which the customer was acquired can then be compared to the time it took them to churn to effectively calculate whether they unsubscribed before they returned the invested amount required to gain them. This can then be measured for all churned customers for a particular period of time to calculate whether a company has a positive revenue trend.

For companies to keep expanding and growing, maintaining higher growth rates than churn rates on a regular basis is essential. In the worst case, if churn rates keep being higher than growth rates, companies will keep losing revenue and possibly have to go into debt or even shut down if the situation persists.

#### Why Measuring Churn Rate Is Important

By calculating their churn rate, companies can gain clear insights into how much they’re able to retain their customers, how good their services are, and the overall success of their business in general.

A trend of growing churn rates can be indicative that something’s wrong with the company’s business. Increasing churn might be a reflection of the poor quality of the service or product the company is selling; it may indicate that it’s overpriced or other issues such as unsatisfactory customer care, and so on.

As such, understanding churn can help companies improve their service and work on eliminating the reasons that make their customers terminate their contracts. By noticing churn increases on time, and acting to reverse them, companies can save a lot in terms of efforts and costs in the long run.

It always costs more to obtain new customers than to retain existing ones. Therefore, maintaining long-lasting relationships with customers is a priority for every subscription-based company — which is why they should always strive to keep churn rates as low as possible.

#### Shortcomings

Useful as it is for measuring business health, the method of measuring churn rates has its shortcomings.

For instance, churn rates don’t take into account what kinds of customers usually terminate their subscriptions or stop buying from the company. Measuring the mere numbers and percentages of customers that churn is not enough for companies to know what types of audiences these churned customers come from, and therefore they can’t evaluate what target groups to focus on simply by using this metric.

Another shortcoming is related to the churn generated from companies ending their promotions or free premium periods, which can be misleading. Customers churning in such situations may have only come for the promotional benefits or may have tested the product or service and found out it didn’t suit them at the end of the day. This is not necessarily relevant to demonstrate how well the business is doing.

Higher growth rates in a previous period can also naturally bring increased churn for a company later. In such a situation, the increase in churn doesn’t have to mean that the company is doing something wrong and is usually just a result of the increase in overall customers. Simply put, when the number of customers grows at a faster rate than usual, there will be more customers terminating their subscriptions as well — just because the overall customer base has increased.

#### Summary

Churn is a term used to measure how many customers a business has lost during a determined time period. Churn is measured in the form of a churn rate, usually as a percentage of churned customers for that particular period. When using churn to measure a business’ health, the metric that is the opposite of churn is growth.

Different kinds of companies can measure churn rates, but the metric is especially useful for companies in the subscription economy, especially those that mostly rely on subscriptions for generating revenue.

Churn can help companies understand why customers leave them and work to eliminate those reasons to retain them. Even so, calculating churn has several shortcomings. It fails to consider the kind of customers that usually churn, and is  sometimes caused by factors other than the quality of the company’s service.

Refer to a candidate's manager, boss, former instructor, colleague, academic advisor, or coach as references.

#### Why is it important to contact personal references?

It is important to reach out to personal references of candidates because they have had up-close experiences with them. You can learn more about their personality and character by listening to their personal stories.

A professional reference, which is typically a supervisor or coworker, can give you an insight into the behavior of the team member at work, while a personal referee can provide details about how they behave outside the office.

Because the application materials don't usually include this information, references can help you discover any weaknesses in the candidate. Talking to their colleagues will give you a good idea of their personality traits as well as their overall character.

You can also find out how they interact with other members of the team to get a clearer idea of whether they are a good fit for the role and your team.

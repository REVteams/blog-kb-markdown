# What is going Dark

## The work of businesses revolves around their customers and the mutual relationship they have with them.

Because of this, businesses will often go to great lengths to acquire new customers — usually through converting leads and prospects — and retain existing ones. Throughout their communication with their customers, however, businesses can encounter several obstacles on the way. One such potential obstacle is when potential or paying customers go dark.

#### Definition

In business language, when a [prospect](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/marketing-sales-prospect-1794386) or paying customer goes dark, it means that they’ve stopped responding to a business’s calls, messages, e-mails, invitations, and other attempts at communicating them. Similarly, a customer or prospect gone dark can mean that when they’ve been given engaging information related to a particular deal, and it can be considered it’s their turn to return the initiative and approach the business — they simply don’t initiate contact with the business for a long time.

With this in mind, the time period it takes for a business to consider a prospect or customer to have gone dark can vary depending on the stage in the sales process when communication was interrupted. For instance, after a business has made a discovery call with a prospect to determine whether they’re a good fit to become a customer, if the prospect doesn’t answer the business’s communication attempts within a few weeks, they can be considered to have gone dark. After the business has sent a potential customer a finalized proposal, on the other hand, the period after which they can consider the customer has gone dark can be up to a day. During the process of striking a deal, a customer can be considered to have gone dark after only a few hours.

#### Reasons for Going Dark

Prospects or customers can go dark for several reasons, such as:

### They’re Busy

Often, prospects and customers simply won’t be able to find the time to return a call or even an email in a timely manner, especially if they’re busy professionals. This doesn’t necessarily mean they’ve lost interest in the deal.

### They’re Bad At Communicating

It may come as a surprise to some that there’s a relatively big amount of people that are simply not so good at talking to or generally communicating in any way with others, especially if they don’t already have a personal connection to them.

Avoiding communication is particularly related to B2C business deals, where the customers and prospects are individuals who may simply mind talking over the phone or even have personal barriers that prevent them to send official responses over emails and other kinds of online messaging.

### They Don’t Prioritize the Deal

Consumers buy products and services all the time, and not everything they show an interest in will always be their top priority. With this in mind, they may simply decide to delay responding to a business that has sent them a proposal when they have other more pressing priorities on their to-do list.

### They Aren’t Able To Commit to a Deal Just Yet

Sometimes, for various reasons, a customer or prospect simply can’t buy a product or subscribe to a deal immediately. This can be because they haven’t decided exactly what they want to buy, haven’t consulted other relevant persons in their immediate surroundings or business, aren’t financially prepared to purchase just yet, and for several other reasons.

In such cases, some customers or prospects may decide to simply stop responding, or refrain from contacting a business when it’s their turn to do so, rather than put themselves in a potentially unpleasant position where they’d have to explain to a representative why they’re not prepared to seal a deal with them at the moment.

### They Avoid Communication Because They’ve Lost Interest

This is likely the worst-case scenario in situations when customers or prospects go dark. Often when they’ve lost interest in buying the proposed product or service because they’ve decided to go for a different one sold by a competitor, have decided the price is higher than they can afford, or for any other reason, customers and prospects can easily go dark.

### For Different Reasons That Can’t Be Determined

Any kind of complication in the customer’s or prospect’s situation, whether it happens in their personal or professional life, can be reason enough for them to cut contact with a business that has reached out to them before. Oftentimes, these reasons can’t be predicted or even imagined, so businesses should take nothing for granted when they’re faced with customers or prospects going dark.

#### How to Engage Dark Prospects or Customers

Some of the approaches businesses can try when attempting to re-engage dark customers and prospects include:

### Focusing On the Sales Process Instead of Their Nonresponsiveness

Dark customers or prospects never like it when they’re being asked why they don’t respond, even in a passive way, such as by receiving a message from representatives that say they just want to check on them. This kind of communication can lead to guilt-tripping, which no business wants its (potential) customers to feel.

Instead, businesses should take a constructive approach when re-contacting dark customers or prospects, focusing on reminding them why they were interested in the deal in the first place and asking them if they’re still on track with it.

### Changing Their Communication Channel

Some individuals rarely check their emails. Others are put off by phone communication, and so on. Businesses can try switching between different contact channels to try to get a response from dark customers and prospects.

### Personalizing Their Message

An attempt to reach out to a dark prospect or customer on a more personal level can work when nothing else does. Using personal information about customers and prospects, businesses can bring it up in a conversation to engage them more easily, and then lead them back to discuss the deal at hand.

### Knowing When To Stop Trying

If a customer or prospect can’t be reached in any way, it’s better for businesses to move on. Their time would be better spent working to acquire new customers.

#### Summary

In business language, when a customer or prospect goes dark, it means they’ve stopped communicating with a business. The period after which a business can consider someone to have gone dark depends on the stage of the sales process they were in.

Customers or prospects can go dark for many reasons. They may be too busy to respond on time, or they may be bad at communicating; perhaps they’re not able to commit to a deal just yet. They can also be avoiding communication because they don’t prioritize the deal they’re being offered, have lost interest in it, or for any other unpredictable complication in their personal or professional lives.

When a customer or prospect goes dark, businesses can engage them through different approaches. They can focus on the sales process instead of their nonresponsiveness when recontacting them, change their communication channel, or personalize their message to reach them, before leading them back into discussing the deal to be closed. If no approach works, and a customer or prospect is still dark, businesses would do best to move on to acquiring other potential customers.

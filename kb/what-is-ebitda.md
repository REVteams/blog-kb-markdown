# What is EBITDA?

## Businesses use a variety of different tools and metrics to measure their operating and financial performance. One such metric is known as “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization”, or EBITDA for short. 

#### Definition

EBITDA is a metric that’s used to measure a company’s earnings before interest, taxes, [depreciation](https://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-is-depreciation-expense), and [amortization](https://rev.team/kb/amortization) — the word itself being an abbreviation for these. This accounting metric often serves the purpose of indirectly representing a company’s current operating profitability and cash flow for a particular period.

#### How Companies Use the EBITDA Metric

EBITDA is considered an accounting standard for larger companies. This metric is an extension of a similar metric known as [EBIT](https://nextlevel.finance/ebit-formula/#), which measures earnings before interest and taxes only. In both cases, companies remove particular factors they aim to exclude from the equation for one reason or another. In the case of EBITDA, these factors include debt-related interest payments, amortization expenses, depreciation methods, and even taxes.

Through EBITDA, companies evaluate and demonstrate how well they’ve performed financially while omitting the capital structure through which they fund themselves (including debt leverage) as well as non-cash items from the measurement. The aim of EBITDA is to analyze how companies turn in profits through their main financial activities and operating decisions alone, without including the impact of the omitted factors.

#### How to Calculate EBITDA

Companies use the following formula for calculating their EBITDA:

**Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization = EBITDA**

In other terms, as the sum of net income, interest, and taxes equals [operating profit](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-calculate-operating-profit-in-business#), the EBITDA calculation formula can also be expressed as:

**Operating Profit + Depreciation + Amortization = EBITDA**

To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a company got a revenue of **\$200 million** during a particular time period while incurring **\$80 million** in production costs and **\$40 million** in operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization cost the company **\$10 million** each, the sum of these expenses being **\$20 million**. The company also spent **\$10** million on repaying interest, generated **\$40 million** in net income while paying another **\$10 million** worth of taxes because of a 20% tax rate, which means that its operating profit — the sum of its net income and the interest and taxes returned to it — was **$60 million** for the time period in question. With this in mind, to calculate its EBITDA, the company has to add its operating profit to the sum of its depreciation and amortization, using the following equation:

**\$60 million + \$20 million = $80 million**

This company’s EBITDA for the particular time period will therefore equal **$80 million**.

EBITDA calculations essentially add back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses to a company’s net income. Interest expenses are disregarded in this metric as they are related to the financing structures of companies. Interest payments are a result of a company borrowing funds, and these differ from company to company. The EBITDA metric adds back interest payments to assist companies in comparing their operational and financial performances more realistically.

Similar to interest payments, tax is also different for different companies, and it usually depends on their location of operations. As different tax rates aren’t an indicator of a company’s overall performance, the EBITDA measurement omits tax-related expenses as well.

Expenses related to depreciation and amortization, sometimes commonly referred to as **D&A,** are non-cash expenses that include costs for tangible and intangible assets that companies incur as they use these assets. As D&A expenses are a result of a company investing in assets in the past, they aren’t a reflection of a company’s performance at the time of measuring EBITDA. These expenses occur when a company’s tangible or intangible assets lose value over time. As such, companies using the EBITDA metric also add back D&A expenses to be able to measure their actual performance more realistically.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of the EBITDA Metric

The EBITDA metric has a number of advantages for those that use it to measure business operating and financial performance. Companies can benefit from EBITDA measurements to project their expected cash flow, as this metric can provide an easily obtainable (if somewhat vague) estimation of the value each company produces for a particular time period. EBITDA is especially significant for [private equity firms](https://hbr.org/2007/09/the-strategic-secret-of-private-equity) that use this metric to compare companies that work within the same sector. Companies can also use it in much the same way when comparing their performances among themselves, and it’s also useful for investors when evaluating potential investments.

However, this metric also has some disadvantages, notably the fact that the [generally accepted accounting principles](https://www.accounting.com/resources/gaap/) (GAAP) and the [international financial reporting standards](https://www.ifrs.org/) (IFRS) don’t recognize it. Many business owners are reluctant to practice EBITDA measurements as well. This is mostly because the metric doesn’t consider all economic factors, as it may make it seem as if the companies using it don’t pay interest rates or taxes, and as if their assets don’t lose value over time. Such an evaluation may paint a somewhat unrealistic image of a company’s financial situation.

#### Summary

EBITDA is a metric through which companies measure their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. EBITDA is a proxy for a company’s cash flow and operating profitability for a particular time period.

Larger companies are more likely to use the EBITDA metric than others. EBITDA is an extension of the EBIT metric, which measures earnings before interest and taxes only. In both of these metrics, companies exclude factors that they don’t wish to disclose for whatever reason.

EBITDA measurements omit factors related to a company’s capital structure and non-cash parameters. This is done so that through EBITDA, company’s can get insights into how their activities create profits for them by omitting the impact of parameters such as taxes, interest, depreciation, and amortization on their financial situation.

EBITDA is calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses to a company’s net income. In other words, to calculate EBITDA, companies add their operating profit (which is the sum of their net income, interest, and taxes) to their D&A (depreciation and amortization) expenses).

EBITDA gives companies a quick estimate of their value, which they can use to compare their own performance to that of their competitors. Private equity firms can also use EBITDA to compare different companies working in the same sector. The metric is also suitable for investors evaluating their investment opportunities.

The metric has some disadvantages too, notably in the fact that the GAAP and the IFRS don’t recognize it. Many companies also avoid this metric because it may make it seem as if companies don’t incur expenses related to interests, taxes, and their assets losing value over time.

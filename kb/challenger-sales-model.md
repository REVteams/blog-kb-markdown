# Challenger Sales Model

## According to the traditional approach to sales, a salesperson convinces their prospects to buy a product or service from the company they work for by following a simple process:

approaching the prospects, communicating with them by identifying their business needs, and promoting the product or service as a solution to these needs until they buy it.

However, this is a somewhat simplistic outlook on the whole sales process, and it doesn’t take some important aspects of the practicalities of sales into account, such as the fact that most prospects already have a good idea of the product or service they wish to buy before they engage in serious contact with a salesperson. All this and more is what advisory company [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/) does research on and talks about in one of their books, ‘[The Challenger Sale](https://www.challengerinc.com/the-challenger-books/)’, which promotes what they call the **Challenger Sales Model**.

#### Definition

The Challenger Sales Model is a sales framework that takes the disruptive approach to solution selling. This approach is used by salespersons that push customers beyond their comfort zones to embrace new ideas for their business. 

This model alludes to the Challenger, one of five sales representative profiles as classified by Gartner. The five profiles are Challenger, Hard Worker, Lone Wolf, Problem Solver, and Relationship Builder.

#### Background

Nowadays, when information is becoming increasingly available to wide audiences, salespersons have to abandon their traditional role of go-to people for everything related to the products and services they sell. This is because their prospects are usually very well informed of what they’re trying to buy and have a general idea of what they expect from the product or service they want, even before contacting a salesperson.  

In such a situation, salespersons must adapt and develop better sales strategies, revolving around an improved customer experience that goes beyond simply explaining the product or service they’re selling. This is something that Gartner analyses through their sales representative profiles.

#### The Five Profiles of Sales Professionals According to Gartner

Throughout their research of sales representatives and their experiences, Gartner split their different approaches into five generalized profiles or models:

* **The Hard Worker** — a profile used to describe salespersons that are self-motivated, willing to go the extra mile, and generally interested in customer feedback in order to improve;
* **The Challenger** — this approach is ascribed to salespersons that always have a different worldview, try their best to understand their customers’ business, love to debate with their customers, and push them to adopt new things;
* **The Relationship Builder** — a type of salesperson that aims to get along with customers more than anything else, and gives them time and space. 
* **The Lone Wolf** — a self-confident, independent salesperson that prefers to follow their own instincts;
* **The Problem Solver** — a reliable responder, detail-oriented type of salesperson that focuses on solving customer problems.

While the Relationship Builder Model seems to be the most popular among these, when it comes to high performance in sales, Gartner concludes that the Challenger Model [outperforms](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales-service/insights/challenger-sale) the other four by far.

#### What Sets the Challenger Sales Model Apart

Salespersons that fall under the Challenger category can understand their customers’ situation more than anyone else. This knowledge, as well as the Challengers’ assertiveness, helps them promote novel ideas to their customers by challenging them, disrupting their way of thinking, and teaching them something new.

Challengers have the ability to notice important details about a customer’s business that they themselves may not be fully aware of — and use these to help them grow. These details can include things that help customers lower their costs, avoid unnecessary risks, take advantage of business opportunities they were missing out on, and more.

Challengers create constructive tension when they deal with customers. This approach is what gives the customers an increased sense of trust and improves the sales experience, which in turn drives their purchase decisions.

A key feature of Challenger-type salespersons is that they take the initiative when dealing with customers. Challengers assume control of the situation in order to make customers appreciate the company and convince them to keep buying products and/or services from it. This assertiveness and grip on the situation is what makes challengers stand out in the complex world of sales.

#### Summary

The Challenger Sales Model is a sales framework that focuses on challenging customers to take on novel approaches to their business. The term was coined in the book ‘The Challenger Sale’ by Gartner as one of five sales representative profiles.

Nowadays, as customers are getting more and more information and ideas about what they want to buy, more traditional sales approaches become obsolete. Challenger-type salespersons can best adapt to this situation by adopting a more disruptive sales style, making them better than all other profiles when it comes to high-performance sales situations.

The Challenger Sales Model uses assertiveness and control to point out important details about the customers’ business, increasing their loyalty in the process, which ultimately drives sales for the company.

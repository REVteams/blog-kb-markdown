To be able to evaluate how healthy their business is, companies often use a variety of metrics at their disposal that help them calculate key parameters indicative of their operating and financial performance. One way of forecasting business health — particularly related to company earnings — is by calculating forward revenue.

#### Definition

The term forward revenue, alternatively known as forward earnings, refers to calculations that companies and analysts make with the aim of estimating their revenue for an upcoming period in the near future. Forward revenue is commonly estimated for a period before the ending of a company’s ongoing fiscal year, or, in some cases, its upcoming fiscal year.

#### How Forward Revenue Estimating Works

Business and investment analysts create forward revenue estimations with the aim of projecting short-term earnings, taxes, margins, and other information related to company finances. This data is commonly used by investors that wish to evaluate and predict the financial performance of different companies.

To get to this kind of information, analysts often have to consult the management team of each individual company for which they want to estimate forward revenue. It’s generally considered that managers have more insights into company trends than anyone else, which makes them qualified to make financial assessments.

The information gathered from managers serves as a basis for analysts projecting forward revenue / forward [earnings per share](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/earnings-per-share-eps). As a common practice, managers provide analysts with information related to the ongoing fiscal year. Throughout the year, they update this information for each [fiscal quarter](https://investinganswers.com/dictionary/q/quarter-q1-q2-q3-q4) as it goes by, or sometimes even during a quarter if important changes occur.

In some cases, managers can even give analysts a more long-term perspective on what they expect from their companies’ future growth rates in terms of sales, cash flow, margins, and more. From here on, after being guided by company management, analysts proceed to make their own forward revenue assumptions based on this guidance.

There are several techniques that companies and analysts alike can employ when estimating forward revenue. These can include reviewing historical revenue performance, market conditions, projections about the future of the economy, the stock market, and more.

#### The Importance of Estimating Forward Revenue

As indicated above, determining the forward revenues of companies is particularly significant to investors. This is because it’s generally considered that a company’s future revenue prospects can be deduced in the present through analyzing the price of the company’s stocks.

Analysts can use forward revenue estimates to calculate a number of forward valuation metrics used in stock valuation. These forward valuation metrics include:

* [Forward P/E](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/forward-pe-ratio/) (price-to-earnings) ratio;
* [Forward P/S](https://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/forward_ps_ratio) (price-to-sales) ratio;
* [Forward EV/EBITDA](https://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/forward_ev_ebitda) (enterprise-value-to-[EBITDA](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-ebitda)) ratio;
* And more.

Investors that have a good understanding of how accurately they can assess each particular type of company are most likely to benefit from forward valuation metrics such as the ones mentioned above. Through these assessments, investors can often decide whether they want to invest in a particular company. If it can be determined with a relative degree of certainty that a company will have good revenue figures in the near future, investors will be far more likely to invest in it.

It’s important to note that analyzing the past revenues of companies can have different results for different companies, industries, and markets. These results can be used to predict forward revenue with different degrees of accuracy.

For instance, for a food manufacturing company operating in a stable market, analysts can come up with forward revenue estimates that would be somewhat accurate. For companies in more turbulent industries such as cloud hosting, on the other hand, forward revenue estimates will usually be less accurate because of the many unpredictable changes the industry can be subject to.

#### Shortcomings

Forward revenue estimates essentially try to predict future company income. As such, much like any other prediction, they can always turn out wrong — the future is hard to predict more often than not. This is the main reason why many investors think twice before they decide to rely on estimating forward revenues when deciding on what company to invest in.

Some analysts can come up with estimates of forward revenues based on informed sources. Even in such cases, however, it’s likely that they still won’t be able to accurately predict different factors that can have a direct influence on forward revenues, including interest rates, stock market changes, changes in business laws, and more.

What’s more, forward revenue projections can be made even more difficult if analysts fail to gain enough information from a company’s management. The lack of relevant data will almost inevitably result in inaccuracies when projecting future revenues.

With all this in mind, many investment analysts believe forward revenue projections are to be avoided when deciding on investments and promote relying on historical revenue instead.

#### Summary

Forward revenue, also known as forward earnings, is a term that refers to estimates made about a company’s revenues in the near future. It’s common for forward revenue to be calculated before the end of a company’s current fiscal year (or in some cases for its upcoming fiscal year).

Analysts estimate forward revenues in order to project short-term earnings, taxes, margins, and other financial data. Investors commonly use these projectors when evaluating the financial performance of companies.

Information needed to come up with accurate forward revenue estimates can usually be obtained through the guidance of company management. As managers have the best insights into their companies’ trends, the information they provide often serves as a basis upon which analysts construct their own projections of the forward revenues of these companies.

When estimating forward revenue, analysts and companies can use a variety of techniques, such as reviewing historical revenue performance, market conditions, projections about the future of the economy, the stock market, and more.

For investors, estimating forward revenue is important because it’s related to analyzing the prices of stocks for different companies. Forward revenue estimations can be used to calculate forward valuation metrics important for stock valuation, including the forward P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio, forward P/S (price-to-sales) ratio, forward EV/EBITDA (enterprise-value-to-EBITDA) ratio, and more. Depending on the type of company, industry, and market, past earnings can be used to estimate forward revenues with varying degrees of accuracy.

With this in mind, forward revenue estimates can often be inaccurate because the future is generally hard to predict, with earnings being no exception. Analysts can fail to predict factors such as interest rates, stock market changes, and changes in business laws even when using informed methods.

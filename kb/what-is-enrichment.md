# What is Enrichment?

## Since its early beginnings at the end of the 20th century, the concept of e-commerce has become a widespread practice. Nowadays, more and more people across the planet engage in online shopping.

This means that, as competition rises among e-commerce businesses, they have to keep refining their selling techniques in order to keep attracting [buyers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer), [closing deals](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal), and thus maintaining a constant increase in their revenue. One of these e-commerce techniques is known as enrichment.

#### Definition

In e-commerce terminology, the term enrichment is used when businesses add additional information about the products, services, or features they sell through their [e-commerce platforms](https://business.adobe.com/au/glossary/ecommerce-platforms.html#:~:text=An%20e%2Dcommerce%20platform%20is,order%2C%20and%20a%20payment%20feature.). E-commerce enrichment is done in a way that emphasizes the added value that the items being sold provide to the business’s customers and [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client).

#### How Enrichment Works

In e-commerce, products and services are sold online, often presented through visual elements that describe them to end-users and potential buyers. In many cases, these items are shown on an e-commerce platform — usually through a business’s own site or a third-party [e-commerce provider](https://websitesetup.org/best-ecommerce-platform/) — with a simple text description to them, and often even an image (especially when it comes to physical products).

While a short text description and an image is the most basic way of presenting items for sale, it’s a low-effort option that won’t always lead to a purchase. To improve its chances of selling an item, an e-commerce business can enrich the way it presents it on its online platform with extra details, such as:

* The colors it comes in;
* Its dimensions;
* The materials it’s made of;
* Different kinds of digital media describing the item (images, videos, and so on);
* Instruction manuals;
* Safety sheets;
* Technical drawings;
* Brochures;
* Related accessories;
* Links to similar products or services;
* And more.

The idea behind enriching products, services, and functions sold through e-commerce is to show the added value these items would bring to a potential buyer.

#### The Importance of Enrichment in E-Commerce

Online shoppers are often looking for every piece of information about items before considering a purchase. In case e-commerce businesses don’t provide them with enough information in a way that makes it quickly accessible to them when browsing their online store, potential customers may quickly lose interest in their purchase, which will lead to a loss in revenue to these businesses. The concept behind e-commerce enrichment is to prevent this from happening by increasing the likeliness of online store browses ending with a purchase.

Even the most basic additional information added to an item’s description — such as the colors in which it comes, the materials it’s made of, its availability in stock (and in what store), delivery options, photos or other descriptive images of it, and so on — can go a long way towards increasing the interest of a potential buyer, and ultimately improving the possibility of a purchase.

In these cases, it’s important to note that businesses must make sure this information is as accurate as possible and constantly updated. Accidentally misinforming online shoppers about an item’s main characteristics can sometimes have the opposite effect of making them lose interest in a purchase.

While these basic characteristics are a good place to start with enrichment, e-commerce businesses can add much more to the description of their products or services to make them even more accessible to potential buyers. For instance, different kinds of digital media — and especially videos — can help online shoppers overcome their doubts and decide to make a purchase. Unlike during physical sales, online shoppers don’t usually communicate with a salesperson which could explain an item’s functionalities in detail and give them a demonstration of how it works. However, a well-placed video (or similar type of media presentation) on an e-commerce platform can be very useful for demonstrating exactly how a product or service works to its potential buyers, which can replace the need for a direct demonstration to at least a certain degree.

When it comes to more technical appliances, additional information such as specification sheets and safety instructions can also be added to the description, which can be particularly helpful for online shoppers looking to buy products that adhere to certain standards. Links to instruction manuals informing shoppers how to handle products and/or services can also be a welcome addition to their descriptions, as well as catalogs and brochures.

If online shoppers show interest in a product or service — and especially if they actually make a purchase — e-commerce businesses can benefit greatly from enriching item descriptions with links to other items related to it. A business’s products or services can often be complemented by other items that the same business has in stock, such as accessories that enhance their functionality or materials they can use to operate. Linking to such items at the right place can help a business drive sales from their already existing customers, and attract those that recognize the value of being able to purchase all they need in one place. What’s more, businesses can sometimes offer these customers a discount for buying multiple related products or services at once, which is also a quality enrichment that can significantly increase the likeliness of a purchase.

#### Summary

The term enrichment is used in e-commerce terminology to refer to the process through which e-commerce businesses add supplementary information about the products, services, or features they sell. The practice of enriching the descriptions of items they sell through their online stores helps e-commerce businesses bring their merchandise closer to their customers and promote the added value it brings them.

Businesses commonly do e-commerce through their own websites or through third-party e-commerce providers. They can enrich the online descriptions of products, services, and features they sell by complementing their e-commerce platform presentation with information such as the colors they come in, their dimensions, the materials they’re made of, digital media such as images and videos that show their functionality, instruction manuals, safety sheets, technical drawings, brochures, accessories, links to similar products or services and more.

For online shoppers, it’s often important to have as much information as possible delivered to them as quickly as possible when browsing items in online stores. Failing to do so may lead to them losing interest in a purchase, which is what enrichment aims to prevent.

# What are Inbound Sales?

## For businesses, sales make up the basis of economic activity. Closing deals with buyers who purchase the products and/or services of a business allows it to be profitable, experience growth, and ultimately succeed on the market.

As the global marketplace is changing at an increasingly dynamic pace, consumers can now purchase more, make more informed decisions regarding their purchases, and have increased their control over the whole purchasing process in general. Sales professionals have adapted to these dynamics by adopting a wide range of sales techniques, many of which are considered less traditional and not commonly associated with the work of salespersons. One such technique is known as inbound sales.

#### Definition

In sales terminology, the term inbound sales is used to describe a selling technique, process, or transaction through which a purchase is made by a customer who directly approaches a business to buy a product or service from it. Inbound sales happen as a result of a business’s strategy to attract [prospects](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/marketing-sales-prospect-1794386) and customers by prioritizing their needs, objectives, and interests, in a way that makes them recognize the business’s product or service as a solution for their problems.

#### How Do Inbound Sales Work?

During inbound sales, businesses respond to the prospects and leads they generate through various activities, particularly those happening in the digital sphere that are designed to attract potential customers. These activities can include leads calling the business’s phone number, contacting it through its website’s chat (commonly by messaging their [chatbots](https://www.drift.com/learn/chatbot/)), downloading materials from the website, filling out web forms, participating in a webinar (or a live seminar) organized by the business, and more. 

Here, salespersons working on inbound sales analyze how their leads behave during the above-mentioned activities, while they’re in the very first stages of the sales funnel — when they become aware that the business may offer them a solution, develop an interest in it, and/or consider purchasing it. Through this type of analysis, experienced inbound sales professionals know how to personalize their sales strategy to each lead, showing them how the business’s solutions are truly the best fit for them.

In this way, inbound salespersons don’t take the more traditional approach of trying to close as many sales in as little time as possible. Instead, they try to approach the point of view of their (potential) customers first, and from there, they try to subtly lead them to decide on purchasing a product or service offered by the business.

This process implies that salespersons need to invest themselves and show special care for the needs and pain points of the leads they want to [convert](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-conversion) to paying customers, which will also take more time and won’t usually result in immediate conversions. However, the time and effort invested in educating leads ultimately pay off, as the prospects will be more likely to convert to long-standing [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) further down the line.

#### Inbound Sales vs. Outbound Sales

As a sales technique, inbound sales are directly opposed to outbound sales, which is suggested in the name itself. Outbound sales represent a more traditional sales method, which businesses nowadays often combined with inbound sales to make the most out of both techniques. 

The outbound sales technique involves practices such as [cold calling](https://rev.team/kb/cold-call), [cold emailing](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-cold-email), [trade show](https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/trade-show) presentations, and other similar ways through which salespersons reach out to prospects directly rather than waiting for these prospects to contact them. Through outbound sales practices, salespersons basically promote their message to as many leads as they can get and in any way they can — while being aware different leads can (and will) show different levels of interest to buy the products or services they’re promoting.

While outbound sales are done through more traditionally established sales practices, in the dynamic modern conditions where more and more marketers and salespeople struggle for the attention of their audiences, they are often deemed too pushy and even discarded as spam in many situations. This is why inbound sales tactics, while traditionally less present in sales circles, have been gaining more and more traction as of late.

Unlike outbound sales practices, inbound sales aim to naturally attract prospects to develop an interest in a business’s products and/or services rather than push them into purchasing these. Whenever a prospect has been pulled to the business via inbound sales methods, sales professionals can then try to qualify this prospect based on the data they have on them, and eventually convert them into a paying customer.

Outbound salespersons may also collect user data when reaching out to potential customers, but much of their promotion is still often based on guesswork, as they’re never sure whether a lead they’re only just initiating contact with actually needs or has shown any interest in the product or service they’re trying to sell them. 

The major advantage of inbound sales is in the strategic approach of salespersons showing that they care for the needs of their leads, which are then, in turn, more inclined to provide them with personal information relevant to the sales process. This eliminates the need for salespersons to go through a lot of effort to discover this kind of information themselves or to have to guess whether a lead is actually interested in purchasing and rely on their luck, which is what happens during outbound sales.

#### Why Are Inbound Sales Tactics Important

The inbound sales method focuses on earning a prospect’s trust, making them feel appreciated and cared for. When inbound sales professionals take their time to show their prospects that they can trust the solutions offered by their business, they will eventually reap the fruits of their patience — many of their prospects will likely consider these salespersons as their go-to when they decide on purchasing a product or service that best suits their needs.

The importance of responding to prospects as quickly as possible — and with it, the importance of inbound sales — is demonstrated by statistics that show that [up to 50%](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/sale-follow-ups/) of deals are closed by the salespersons that are the first to respond to a prospect showing interest in a product or service. This means that it’s in a salesperson’s best interest to adopt a highly responsive inbound sales approach when their prospects actually make the move and start asking questions related to their future purchase. It is crucial that these prospects are retained in this very early stage of the sales funnel, because otherwise, they may actually vouch for a competitor who responds sooner.

With this in mind, for many salespersons working for a [commission](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-commission) that requires them to close as many deals as possible and as fast as they can, the slower inbound sales method may seem less attractive. However, their competitors that do use inbound sales, while rarely ever seeing immediate results, will often manage to build more long-term, stable relationships with their prospects turned clients. 

In this way, the inbound sales method helps salespersons help their customers and develop a relationship of mutual satisfaction with them in a slow but steady way. Businesses only stand to gain from such a strategic approach, as the trust and [engagement](https://rev.team/kb/engagement) they’ll get from their clients-to-be will bring them increased revenue streams as a result.

#### Summary

Inbound sales are a type of selling technique, process, or transaction through which a customer directly approaches a business to purchase a product or service from it. These sales happen when a business takes a strategic approach to attract prospects to recognize the solution it offers them by prioritizing their needs, objectives, and interests.

The process of inbound sales implies that businesses respond to the leads that contact them, which they obtained through a variety of (mostly digital) activities, including phone calls, website chat communication, downloading materials, webinar participation, and more. Salespersons analyze how their leads behave during these activities and use this analysis to create personalized selling approaches for each one of their leads.

The inbound sales method is directly opposed to outbound sales, which is a more traditional approach. During outbound sales, salespersons reach out to their leads themselves by means such as cold calls, cold emails, trade show presentations, and more. In the dynamic modern world, outbound sales activities can often be considered intrusive to leads, which may often not be interested in purchasing. As opposed to this, inbound salespersons try to create a natural interest for the products or services among their leads, which can then provide them with personal data related to their preferences and eventually be attracted to commit to a purchase.

Inbound sales are an important tool because, through them, a salesperson shows care about their prospect’s needs and is responsive to their demands, which in turn makes it more likely for these prospects to be converted to paying customers further down the line. While the inbound sales method requires more time and dedication than its outbound counterpart which focuses on rapid deal closing, it also creates lasting relationships with future clients that pay off in the long term.

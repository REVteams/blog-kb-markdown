It can be a problem if you don't know how you found out about the job. This could make your interview less professional and even cost you the job. Employers often ask this very early.

No matter how or where you heard about the job opening, be specific about what attracted your attention about it. Be clear about your intentions and who you are.

They might have posted their job on two job boards and created a YouTube video detailing their hiring needs. They want to know which efforts have been most successful, so they will often start a phone interview asking questions like "How did you hear about this job?"

### 10 Answer Examples

It's fine to tell the truth in most cases when you explain how they got their job. If any of these reasons are true, then you can simply tell them the truth during the interview.

1. You were actively looking for work and found it on job sites or career websites. That's how you first saw the job.
2. A friend or colleague in the company suggested that you apply. 
3. A friend or colleague who isn't working in the company right now but heard that they were hiring.
4. You saw a press release, article, or other sources claiming that they were hiring.
5. You were interested in the company's products and services, and you read an article about it. So you decided to search for job opportunities with them.
6. A recruiter contacted you and put you in touch.
7. You visited their website for another reason, and you saw their "Careers” page.
8. You like their company and went to their "Careers" page to search for a job opportunity.
9. You saw an advertisement on LinkedIn, Facebook, or elsewhere for a job posting.

#### Full Sample Answers

Let's now look at some word-for-word examples to see how we found out about this position.

This will allow you to feel at ease and give you some ideas that you can use to help you create your solution. Let's start with active job seekers. Next, We'll show you how to interview passive job seekers or those who are not currently employed.

#### Sample Answer for Active Job Seekers:

> *"I am actively job hunting right now and found your job posting via LinkedIn while searching for Senior Engineer positions. I thoroughly researched the job description on linked in before applying. It seemed like a great fit, so I decided to apply."*

#### Sample Answer for Passive Job Seekers:

The bottom line: The most successful job seekers are careful about their job search and seek the RIGHT job.

That's what you should aim for when you answer "How did you hear about us?". Show them that you are seeking the job with purpose and not just applying everywhere to find an employer who will hire you.

#### Avoid These Mistakes

Let's now look at what to NOT say after you've seen some examples of answers to how you heard about this job. These are the answers you should avoid:

* Do not say that you aren't sure or don't recall. This will make it more difficult to get hired.
* Do not pretend to be applying for every job that you find. This will make you sound desperate and like a job seeker who doesn’t care if they get hired.
* You should not lie if it could get you arrested (like saying that you saw them on a Job Board if they haven't posted any jobs on a Job Board).

Tell the truth or use one of the 10 reasons mentioned in the previous section.

Let your answers be short and precise. If the interviewer needs more information, they will ask.

I recommend that you limit your answer to no more than one or two sentences. When they ask you how you found out about the job, nobody is trying to trick you or make you fall for it. It's not a trap. 

### How to Stand Out with Your Answers

Top job seekers are focused on going to the interview to learn about a job, have an open conversation, and determine if it's a good match for them. They aren't desperate and they don't even know if they want the job.

They want to learn more about it, ask questions, and then make a final decision.

This will help you get more job offers from higher-ranking employers. This is a great way to impress hiring managers.

This is demonstrated by giving a clear and concise answer to the question "How did you hear about this position?"

...Act confident and not look desperate during interviews while asking great questions. These are the top questions recruiters should ask. Interview questions will often be asked about how you heard of the job during the first interview with a recruiter.

#### Highlight These Points

1. Clearly state the source of the job information from which you learned about the position.
2. There is no need to go into detail. You can simply mention the name of the person, company, or resource.
3. Discuss the factors that attracted you to the job.
4. Describe why you believe you are qualified to do the job.
5. Be enthusiastic about the opportunity to join the job.

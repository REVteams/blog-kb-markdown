# What is a Covenant

## Everyday economic activities often rely on loans and credits. However, giving out a loan often carries risks for the lender, as they can never be completely sure whether the borrower will be able to return said loan.

Because of the risks associated with loans, there are mechanics in place to prevent or alleviate unwanted outcomes from lending. One such mechanic is the covenant.

#### Definition

A covenant, in financial dealings, is a part of an official loan or bond agreement through which a lender requires a borrower to either fulfill certain conditions or refrain from performing certain actions. Covenants usually come in the form of clauses in such agreements. 

The practice of including covenants in agreements is most common in [indenture](https://efinancemanagement.com/sources-of-finance/bond-indenture) contracts. It’s also present in bank loans as well as any other kind of formal debt agreement between a lender and a borrower.    

#### How Covenants Work

The idea behind the existence of covenants is to protect lenders from borrowers not fulfilling their obligations to return loans as a consequence of personal mismanagement or business-related failure.  

In finance, covenants are mostly used to regulate financial ratios that a borrower should maintain — for example, a covenant can determine the maximum limit of additional loans that can be taken. Other than such ratios, covenants may also refer to a variety of different conditions such as lenders being obliged to pay minimum dividends, remain within a particular business sector, keep certain important employees, and more. 

Loan agreements often contain provisions stating that if the borrower breaks a covenant, the lender has a right to make the debt due right away and charge it. However, in reality, making debts due prematurely in such a way is a rare occurrence because that beats the purpose of a covenant, which is supposed to ensure the payment of the debt. Forcing a borrower to do so ahead of time carries a high risk of them going bankrupt soon afterward. In such cases, lenders can sometimes refrain from acting upon covenant breaches. Alternatively, they can also resort to making changes in the contract that will help them alleviate the damage from the covenant breach, such as raising interest rates.

#### Covenant Types

In broad terms, covenants can be divided into two categories: positive and negative covenants.

### Positive Covenants

Covenants that oblige borrowers to fulfill certain conditions or perform certain actions are called positive covenants. In case a borrower breaches such a covenant, the lender can usually consider this action as defaulting on the part of the borrower. 

Sometimes, loan agreements include clauses that allow borrowers to fix covenant breaches for a certain (usually short) time period after they happen. If a borrower fails to do so, a lender has the right to request them to repay the debt right away, including interest rates.

Positive covenant examples include lenders obliging borrowers to:

* Keep a certain level of insurance;
* Follow related laws and regulations;
* Reach a concrete amount in operating expenses;
* And more.

### Negative Covenants

Those covenants that prohibit borrowers from engaging in particular activities are considered negative covenants. They’re put in place with the aim of preventing borrowers from harming their financial or business situation to the point of not being able to pay off their debt resulting from the loan agreement.

In most cases, a negative covenant comes in the form of a financial ratio that borrowers are obliged to keep up with for a particular period. A common example of a financial ratio covenant is one requiring borrowers to have a particular debt-to-earnings ratio that doesn’t go over a determined maximum amount. This acts as a deterrent preventing the borrower from taking too many loans that they may not be able to pay off, making them likelier to return the debt they owe to the lender. 

Interest coverage ratios are also commonly present among negative covenants. Such covenants oblige borrowers to have an [EBIT](https://gocardless.com/en-us/guides/posts/earnings-before-interest-and-taxes/) that’s proportionally higher than their interest rate by a particular number of times, preventing them to go below this number. This kind of covenant is used to ensure that a borrower doesn’t drop beyond a particular level of earnings that a lender seems high enough to enable the borrower to pay off their debt in a timely manner.  

When it comes to non-ratio-related covenants, an example of such a case would be when a lender prohibits a borrower’s business to venture into a different business sector than the one they currently work in. This kind of prohibition in a covenant usually means that the lender considers the borrower to specialize in their current business field, and thus able to repay the debt if they continue working in it, while there may be a risk that they fail to do so should their business switch to a different kind of activity.

#### How Do Covenants Affect Lenders and Borrowers

A covenant in a loan agreement can be a very useful addition, but it can also bring certain disadvantages as well. 

### Covenant Advantages

For a lender, a covenant brings a certain level of security. Covenants aim to protect lenders from not having their loans returned to them, by ensuring the financial stability of borrowers and enabling them to pay off their debts as foreseen in the contract. Covenants also give lenders increased control over the loan repayment conditions, and give them a number of legal advantages that protect them from unwanted consequences in case borrowers breach them.

Borrowers, on the other hand, can use covenants to instill a sense of confidence in their lenders, giving them a guarantee that they will be able to repay the loans. Being legally obliged to maintain ratios or have a particular amount of earnings can also help borrowers ensure their own financial stability.

### Covenant Disadvantages

While covenants mostly favor lenders, they still can’t fully guarantee that they’ll have their loans repaid to them 100% of the time. In some cases, not even covenants can prevent particular borrowers from defaulting or going bankrupt.

Covenants, obviously, also have disadvantages for borrowers since they’re mostly very restrictive to them. Both preventing borrowers from engaging in certain activities and obliging them to fulfill certain demands can be taxing on them, limit their space for independent economic growth, and restrict their freedom of pursuing their own business. In case they breach a covenant for any reason, borrowers may be faced with severe financial consequences that can be seriously harmful to their financial situation.

#### Summary

In financial terminology, the term covenant is used to refer to a part of a loan contract that obliges the borrower to fulfill certain criteria or prohibits them from performing certain actions. Covenants are most common in indenture contracts, but can also be found in any formal loan agreement.

Covenants exist to ensure lenders that their borrowers will be able to repay their loans to them. In case a covenant is breached, the lender can demand immediate repayment of the entire loan complete with interest rates. In reality, however, lenders often avoid insisting on such actions so as not to risk pushing their borrowers into bankruptcy. 

Positive covenants require borrowers to fulfill certain conditions, such as maintain insurance levels, follow laws, and so on. Negative covenants, on the other hand, prohibit borrowers from engaging in certain activities, such as going below a particular ratio, switching business sectors, and so on.

This means that they’re inundated with CVs and resumes from applicants — most of them to be rejected. In any case, companies have to check all applications, in one way or another, to decide which candidates can pass the preliminary stage.

Going through vast numbers of applications is not something all companies are able to pull off, though. More often than not, a regular company recruiter or hiring manager may find it impossible to go through each individual resume they’ll get in detail, and this is especially true for larger companies. This is where applicant tracking systems step in.

#### Definition

An applicant tracking system, or ATS, is a kind of software that companies use to help them with the process of choosing new employees to hire. ATSs help a company’s recruiting team with collecting, sorting, scanning, and ranking the resumes they get from candidates who apply for openings.

Nowadays, most companies use one of the many [ATS software solutions](https://www.myshortlister.com/applicant-tracking-system/vendor-list) available on the market for handling their job applications. Because of this, many of the resumes sent to companies will often not even reach the people that make up the recruitment team if the ATS software eliminates them as inadequate beforehand. This software-based process of handling applications has completely changed the traditional outlook on recruiting.

#### Why ATS Software Is Important

ATS software simplifies the application browsing process, and in a way it even automates it. This helps a company’s recruiters and hiring managers in two significant ways:

* **It saves time** — An ATS puts all applications through its software, sparing the recruiting team from the obligation of doing it the “old-fashioned” way by going through each of the candidates’ resume individually; and
* **It eliminates human error** — If a recruiter were to go through each application one by one, not only would it take them too much time, but they’d also be prone to omitting or misinterpreting certain details in the process. The machine precision of an ATS software effectively eliminates this risk.

Because of all this, companies tend to base most of their candidate application procedures on ATS software nowadays. The most recent advancements in ATS technology make it much easier for recruiters to manage the entire process of hiring for their companies.

When a company using an ATS gets job applications, all relevant information for each candidate (education, work experience, resume, motivational letter, contact info) is stored in the ATS’s database. Recruiters can then use this information for a number of purposes relevant to the entire hiring process, such as browsing through applications, arranging interviews, verifying references, testing the candidates that got through the preliminary phase, handling the hiring of those who got through, and more.

The automation and simplification of the whole recruitment process also help companies save money. Without ATS software, they’d be spending more on hiring staff to work with sorting and filing applications, among other things.

Another important thing about ATS software is that through it, companies can see where exactly the candidates saw the opening — their website, job boards, social media, direct referrals, or elsewhere. Knowing this can help companies understand where most of their potential employees can be found. In this way, they can increase their recruitment efforts in the areas where they’re most likely to find suitable candidates, and reduce them in those areas where not many candidates can usually be found.

ATS software helps candidates save time, too. Many of the ATS solutions available to recruiters let candidates access platforms where they’ve already sent their resumes, important information, experience, education, and references, to be reused for their application. In this way, candidates can directly copy all the relevant details from their LinkedIn profile, for example — and while they may need to edit it to suit the post they’re currently applying for, it saves them a lot of effort by not forcing them to re-enter all their LinkedIn info each time they apply for a new opening.

#### How ATS Software Works

An ATS’s primary task consists of gathering and storing applications in its database so that the recruitment team can have quick access to them. These applications don’t get discarded if the applicants didn’t get the job, though — they remain stored in the database so that the company can keep the applicants in mind for future openings as well.

ATS software comes with several features for sorting and browsing through their databases. This makes it easier for recruiters and hiring managers to go through all stored applications for whatever reason.

For instance, recruiters can browse all applications sorted by a specific category, and glance through them by looking only at their previous job experience. By having all applications sorted in this way, recruiters can quickly evaluate each one and decide whether they should open it up and check out the whole resume, or let it be auto-sorted by the ATS.

Recruiters can also browse the ATS database through keywords. For example, if they’re looking for a candidate that has previous experience of working in a particular role, recruiters can search the database for this role to get a quick list of all candidates whose resumes include it as a keyword. With this kind of search, recruiters can also combine multiple keywords to further narrow down the list of candidates to those that have all these keywords present in their applications. This functionality is extremely useful for creating shortlists.

By taking the job description that companies provide into consideration, the ATS software can also auto-rank all applications it receives to determine how well they’d fit the opening. To do this, the ATS analyzes each application on several bases and then assigns a score to them. This effectively provides the company with an automatically generated top-list of candidates which the recruitment team can use in whatever way they deem necessary.

The ATS software can also be used for candidate interactions. With it, recruiters can customize automated messages to be sent out to candidates, informing them that the company has received their applications and that they’ll let them know if they have been shortlisted. Recruiters can even do online tests with applicants through their ATS.

The hiring team can also use the ATS software for arranging interviews with shortlisted candidates — and send rejection emails to those that didn’t make it past any stage in the recruitment process. When candidates get hired, HR can access the ATS database to put them on the payroll.

#### The Downsides of ATS

While ATS software makes the lives of recruiters significantly easier, it can come with some setbacks that are worth keeping in mind when using this type of software.

Most notably, the software’s artificial intelligence is prone to technical errors. These are most likely to occur with scanned resumes, where the software might misinterpret certain information, either because of issues with the scanning process, or the inability of the ATS software to read scans correctly. Even without these technical issues, ATS software can misinterpret certain resumes if they’re submitted in a different format than what the specific ATS is programmed to process.

What’s more, recruiters browsing their ATS for keywords can also cause them to overlook certain resumes of candidates that may actually be suitable for the opening. For instance, if a good candidate had switched careers in the past, the ATS might reject them because their resume lacks the keywords the recruiters used for the search. The company may miss out on talent in this way.

#### Summary

An applicant tracking system (ATS) is a software tool that provides companies with a job applicant database.

The company’s recruitment team uses ATS software to make the hiring process faster and easier. Most companies put all job applications they receive through their ATS.

# What is a Client

## The main goal of any company in business is to sell as much as possible in order to survive and keep thriving on the market.

For this purpose, companies are always trying to get as many [buyers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) for their products or services as possible, often competing over these buyers with other companies that they share a marketplace with.

This is what makes buyers — more colloquially known in the business terminology as **customers** — a key driving force behind every company’s success. This is especially the case for clients, which are a very specific type of customer. 

#### Definition

A client is an entity — individual or organization — that pays another entity for products purchased or services rendered. A defining trait of clients is the continuous relationship they have with those entities (usually businesses) that they buy from. In business terms, this is known as a **client relationship.**

#### The Difference Between a Client and a Customer

In practice, the term ‘client’ is often conflated with other terms with a similar meaning such as ‘buyer’ and ‘customer’. Some companies don’t even make a difference between these. This is somewhat understandable because all these terms can refer to anyone purchasing products and services from a business, but there is a slight difference in several details, however.

The business concept of clients revolves strongly around the continuous relationships that businesses develop with them. The very nature and profoundness of these client relationships is what defines clients and sets them apart from regular customers or buyers. 

This is not to say that a customer can’t have any kind of a relationship with a business, or that they cannot maintain a continuous inflow of purchases, though. On the contrary, customers do develop relationships with businesses they buy from too, but unlike client relationships, these tend to be less in-depth and often focus on the customers’ short-term needs rather than on building meaningful bonds with these businesses. When it comes to buyers, the meaning of their relationship to businesses is even more narrow than that of customers, revolving solely around the act of purchasing the products or services these businesses provide.

For businesses, client relationships represent much more than customer interactions. Clients are those customers that display a higher level of loyalty towards the businesses they buy from. Client relationships can’t be reduced to short-term interactions — to maintain them, companies need to constantly show their care for their clients and the value they bring to their business.

#### Why Clients Are Important for Businesses

Clients don’t simply buy products or services, they also build personal relationships with their providers. They aim to get a long-term value out of the items they pay for and bring value back to the companies that sell these, by providing them with constant feedback, working together to come up with novel ways in which these products and services can enhance their mutual experience, and striving to bring about the success of the companies they buy from. 

Often, the most loyal clients of a business will also promote it to their peers. This can be done in many ways, ranging from clients indirectly promoting companies through the continuous purchase of their products or services made visible to their circle of acquaintances, to more directly promoting them by reaching out to other potential customers — [influencer marketing](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/influencer-marketing/) being a notable example of this. 

Clients are, in a way, investors in the long-term development of companies. They don’t simply focus on the purchasing process and occasionally contact [customer support](https://www.helpscout.com/helpu/definition-of-customer-support/) if there’s a need. They see the big picture in their relationship with businesses, treating it more as a partnership rather than a simple exchange.

#### How Businesses Attract Clients

Companies value their client relationships more than anything else, so they would never miss out on an opportunity to gain more clients wherever they can. To do this, they can use various approaches. Some of these include:

* **Turning customers into clients** — For businesses, [retaining](https://www.shopify.com/blog/customer-retention-strategies) customers and having them come back to buy more products or services is much easier and less costly than actually getting new customers. When done right, customer retention can go beyond having customers repeat their purchases, creating an atmosphere of increased trust and cordiality between them and the business. These are the first steps towards creating a long-lasting bond that can be characterized as a client relationship further down the road.
* **Engaging with business organizations** — Depending on the sectors they work in, companies can join various business organizations pertaining to these fields that can serve as network groups for them. In such organizations, different parties that share the same interests can be found. Companies can easily expand their leads in such environments. After that, they just need to approach the contacts that show the biggest potential of becoming their clients. 
* **Advertising** — A well-placed ad can go a long way towards gaining new clients for a company. This is especially true for online advertising campaigns, where more advanced computer metrics can be used to determine what target audiences are most likely to buy a particular product or service, and how to get their attention.  
* **Outreach activities** — Companies often organize events that serve as a kind of indirect ad for their services. Community-based and charity activities are a good way to attract new customers as well as potential clients. Promotional events for a company’s products or services can have the same effect. A company’s employees can even advertise it through their personal activities and daily interactions with members of target audiences.
* **Referrals** — Loyal clients that have been using a company’s products or services for some time can often directly refer their peers to the company. This is one of the most effective ways of gaining new clients, although it only happens to companies that already have a developed client base.
* **Social media** — In the age of the internet, social media is one of the fastest and most effective ways to sell and obtain clients. From email campaigns to LinkedIn and Instagram, companies regularly take advantage of the omnipresence of social media to expand their client base and grow their business.
* And more.

#### Summary

A client is an individual or an organization that buys a product or service from another party, usually a business, and develops a specific kind of relationship with it in the process.

The term ‘client’ is often used in the same way as other similar terms, such as ‘buyer’ and ‘customer’ — but there is a difference. Clients are a more loyal kind of customers, whose relationship with the businesses they buy from is more profound.

Clients don’t simply purchase products and services — they try to use them in a way that benefits them in the long-term. In this process, they develop more personal bonds with businesses, providing them with constant feedback and supporting them in general. 

Client relationships bring much value to companies, and that’s why they always try to increase their client base. This can be done in many ways: through converting regular customers into clients, engaging with business organizations, advertising, organizing different outreach activities, getting referrals from existing clients, using the potential of social media, and more.

# What are Drag-Along Rights?

## At different points throughout their lifetime, some businesses and their shareholders may have to undergo processes such as selling some or all of their shares, mergers, and even full company takeovers.

All these processes may lead to complicated situations for shareholders and acquirers alike. To prevent this, the rights of all parties participating in such transactions are often included under different clauses of the terms of share class offerings and acquisition agreements. One such clause is the drag-along rights clause. 

#### Definition

The term drag-along rights refers to a clause in a contract that stipulates that if a shareholder owning a majority of the shares within a company wishes to sell their shares to a third party, they can compel the remaining minority shareholders to sell their own shares to the same acquirer. The majority shareholder effectively drags the minority shareholders along in consenting to the sale of the company. 

The drag-along rights clause usually also states that the prospective owner has to offer the minority shareholders the same terms and price as the ones offered to the majority shareholder. 

#### Drag-Along Rights and Tag-Along Rights

Another contract clause that is often compared to drag-along rights is known as [tag-along rights](https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/2-107-7361?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true). The concepts behind these two clauses are similar, both referring to the rights of shareholders and acquirers during mergers and acquisitions. The main difference between them is that drag-along rights allow a majority shareholder to make minority shareholders participate in the company sale by selling their own shares, whereas tag-along rights don’t oblige them to do sell their shares (while still giving them the option to do so). 

With that in mind, tag-along rights protect the interests of minority shareholders much more than drag-along rights do. Drag-along rights mostly protect majority shareholders willing to sell their shares to bidders.

#### How Drag-Along Rights Clauses Are Used

Potential buyers looking to acquire companies are likely to be attracted by drag-along rights clauses in the sales contracts. This is because anyone attempting to acquire a company usually prefers to have as much ownership of it as possible after the acquisition.

In essence, drag-along rights clauses are useful for neutralizing minority shareholders and preventing them from holding back a company’s sale when a majority shareholder has already agreed upon it with a prospective acquirer. With this in mind, drag-along rights largely benefit majority shareholders as well as acquirers while providing fewer advantages for minority shareholders, mostly represented through the guarantee they’ll get the same terms and conditions as the majority shareholders during the sale.

In contracts, drag-along rights are usually strictly defined, but the details around them may vary from company to company. A particular aspect of drag-along rights clauses that acquirers must be aware of is the fact that different companies have a different definition of what exactly constitutes a majority (or a minority) ownership of shares. This is because share classes aren’t the same for every company. What a particular company considers to be a majority or a minority shareholder can sometimes be connected to the ownership and voting rights as stated in the company’s bylaws.

Companies can introduce drag-along rights while doing capital fundraiser campaigns, or while negotiating with prospective acquirers. In most legal situations, drag-along and other similar rights (such as tag-along) aren’t considered statutory rights, and companies can only introduce them in their shareholders’ agreement, or alternatively in the articles of association of the company.

Drag-along rights clauses are an effective way to push for a complete takeover of a company by its majority shareholder, taking all of the shares of the company being sold from all shareholders that held them prior to the acquisition. As such, they can be a particularly attractive option when acquiring private companies.

#### Potential Advantages for Minority Shareholders

Focusing on protecting the rights of majority shareholders, drag-along rights serve minority shareholders only to the extent of reducing the harm from having to sell their shares. Still, in a vast majority of cases, drag-along rights clauses also imply equalizing the price, terms, and conditions at which shares are being sold to the acquirers across the whole board, which means minority shareholders get the same terms as their majority counterparts. This is usually considered a huge plus for the otherwise unprivileged minority shareholders in this scenario, as if it weren’t for a drag-along rights clause, they would probably not be able to sell their own shares at the same value as those of a majority shareholder.

What’s more, a drag-along clause usually states that the majority shareholder must inform the remaining minority owners about the whole procedure in a timely and orderly manner. This means that all minority shareholders will be informed well in advance about having to sell their own shares along with those of the majority shareholder, as well as the price and conditions related to the sale. In case a majority shareholder fails to enact all the procedures that a drag-along rights clause implies, all other parties are legally allowed to disregard the clause.

#### Summary

A drag-along rights clause in a contract gives the right to a company’s majority shareholder, who’s willing to sell their shares to a potential buyer, to make the other majority shareholders do the same with their own shares. In most drag-along rights clauses, minority shareholders are guaranteed the same terms, conditions, and prices like the ones majority shareholders get.

One concept that’s very similar, and often compared to that of drag-along rights, is the similarly-sounding tag-along rights. Both of these concepts are formed on the same basis—regulating the act of majority and minority shareholders selling their shares through a clause in an agreement. The major difference between the two is that a tag-along clause, unlike its drag-along counterpart, only suggests that minority shareholders sell their own shares to the same acquirer the majority shareholder sold them to, without forcing them to do so. Tag-along rights are much more suitable for minority shareholders than drag-along rights.

Drag-along rights clauses neutralize minority shareholders who might otherwise stand in the way of a company’s complete takeover by a potential buyer that has already agreed to buy the shares of the majority shareholder. This makes these clauses useful for majority shareholders and especially for potential acquirers who often prefer to have total control over the company they’re acquiring. However, different companies may define what a majority and minority shareholder is differently, so acquirers must keep this in mind when dealing with drag-along rights in contracts.

While drag-along rights clauses are less beneficial for minority shareholders, they do provide a rare opportunity for them to sell their shares at the same terms and price as those of the majority shareholder, a feature which they normally won’t be able to benefit from in other situations. Drag-along rights clauses also include particular procedures around properly informing minority shareholders about the sale. In case the majority shareholder doesn’t follow these procedures properly, the drag-along rights clause can be nullified.

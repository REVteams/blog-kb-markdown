# What is a Complex Sale

## The main business activity for generating profits, and often the only one, is selling products or services. However, the sales process is sometimes not as simple as approaching buyers and selling them an item.

This is why, in sales terminology, there exists a phenomenon known as a complex sale.

#### Definition

A complex sale is a type of sale involving multiple decision-makers, custom service or purchase agreements, and relatively longer sales cycles. Complex sales most often occur in [B2B](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2b) markets, though they can also happen outside of them. Enterprise sales is another name that’s used for this kind of sales.

#### Characteristics of Complex Sales

Because there is more than one decision-maker involved as the buying party in a complex sale, the sales team usually has to convince most of them to actually close the deal, instead of just a single person. This is the primary factor that makes complex sales distinguishable from regular sales.

Complex sales are also characterized by having much longer sales cycles than regular ones. It can take salespersons up to a year (or sometimes even more) to close a complex sale. This is often the case because it takes a lot of time to convince the buyers to seal the deal, usually because they consider that the risk of buying the product or service in question is higher, or because they deem it’s beyond what they can afford. 

Another aspect that adds to the complexity of complex sales is related to the internal relations and even struggles that may exist between the decision-makers influencing the buying decision. This can be especially common in B2B sales. Within certain businesses, struggles between departments and key position holders for internal reasons can lead to some actors swaying the buying decision in one way or another, completely non-related to the sellers or the products/services they offer. 

A similar situation can also occur during complex B2C sales. When selling to a group of end-users, or a single user that has to hear the opinion of some other relevant persons close to him before making the final decision regarding a purchase, interpersonal relationships between all these individuals can lead to difficulties and prolonging the sales cycle. A common example of such a situation would be when a business tries to sell a product or service to a family, where either all family members are decision-makers, or there’s one final decision-maker that still has to consult the rest of the family before making the purchase. As relations between members of a family can be complex, they have the potential to delay a purchase. 

#### Decision Maker Types

When attempting to close a complex sale, salespersons have to closely focus on those decision-makers that are most likely to push the final decision in favor of a purchase. Different individuals can play the role of decision-makers depending on the type of complex sale. 

### B2B

In B2B sales, complex sales are likely to occur more than anywhere else. The structure of decision-makers in businesses can also be somewhat complex, which is usually not the case outside B2B situations.

When businesses make purchase-related decisions, there’s one key decision-maker, and in some cases, this person has the last word. This person is higher up in the business’ sales hierarchy — usually, the individual in charge of sales, or the head of the particular department that needs the kind of product or service the other business is offering (for example, the chief executive of the company’s IT department when purchasing computer equipment). 

Apart from the main decision-maker, in the case of complex sales, there are also other, usually less relevant decision-makers. These commonly include people that work closely together with the main decision-maker, such as their assistants or gatekeepers. They can also include other individuals from different departments within the company, such as those that will directly work with the product or service in question, those that will be charged with maintaining it, and others.   

### B2C

When a business sells directly to consumers, there can be multiple decision-makers behind the purchase decision as well. While this can postpone the selling process enough for it to qualify as a complex sale, the structure of the decision-making side is usually far less complicated than in B2B cases. Still, much like with B2B, in B2C sales there’s also usually one main decision-maker as well as others they have to consult with. 

As mentioned above, family members commonly make up the decision-making party during a B2C complex sale. This means that the main decision-maker’s spouse, parents, children, and sometimes even other family members can have a say in the purchase decision. In this case, the group of decision-makers usually consists of family members that either live together, are very close, or intend to use the same product or service the main decision-maker wants to buy. 

Alternatively, other individuals close to the main decision-maker, such as their close friends or roommates, can also assume the role of decision-makers.

#### Important Factors for Complex Sales

For any business, the decision to launch themselves in a complex sale, especially in a B2B environment, can be a challenging undertaking. Businesses have to consider several factors when they want to close a complex sale, such as:

* **Timeframe** — Complex sales are a long shot in terms of time. Businesses need to carefully evaluate whether they can afford to receive their profit later on — that is, if the deal is closed at all. That’s why it’s a common practice for businesses to engage in multiple complex sales at once, keeping a somewhat constant inflow of money over time while aiming to attract new buyers all along.
* **Resources** — Complex sales need some deliberation and convincing to get the buyers to close a deal. This is why companies need well-trained and experienced sales professionals to be able to rely on this type of sales, as well as financial means to keep their businesses running while waiting for the long sales process of complex sales to finally result in a profit.
* **Inside advocates** — When dealing with multiple decision-makers, especially in B2B situations, it’s always a huge plus if at least one of them, or someone else near to them, is willing to help the sellers. This can come in the form of directly influencing the decision-making process or simply providing the sellers with relevant inside information on the dynamics within the decision-making side.
* **Market size** — Analyzing the total market where particular products or services can be sold is also important for closing complex sales. Sales teams want to know who they can sell to before they can develop a successful sales strategy.
* **Customer support** — Complex sales often sell complex products and services. This means that it’s likely that [customer support](https://www.helpscout.com/helpu/definition-of-customer-support/) can be required by the buyers. Sellers need to be well aware of their capacities for post-deal support (whether by their own company or outsourced to other affiliates) and plan their complex sale ventures accordingly.
* And more.

#### Summary

The term complex sale is used to describe a sale including multiple decision-makers, custom service or purchase agreements, and lengthy sales cycles. Complex sales mostly happen in B2B transactions, though they’re not unique to them and can occur in B2C sales as well.

Complex sales cycles can take up to a year, or sometimes even more. This is usually because the buyers deem this kind of sale too costly or have to consult with other decision-makers before they make the purchase, which means that the salespersons will need some time to convince them.

In B2B complex sales, there’s usually a main decision-maker such as a company’s head of sales or department executive, and other decision-makers they have to consult with such as their assistants, the employees using the product or service they’re buying, and so on. In B2C complex sales, the decision-makers are usually family members, close friends, roommates, and so on.

Before a business decides to start doing complex sales, they have to consider several factors. These factors include the timeframe, the resources at the business’ disposal, whether they have inside advocates among the decision-makers on the buying side, the size of the market they can sell their products and services in, their ability to provide customer support to those they sell to, and more.

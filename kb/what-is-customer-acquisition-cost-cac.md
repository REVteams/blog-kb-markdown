# What is Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

## Businesses need to generate revenue to grow. To do so, they rely on attracting buyers, or customers, to sell their products and/or services to.

However, attracting buyers can often be a challenging task, as it often requires time and effort — and more importantly, incurs costs on the part of the business. To measure these costs, businesses use a metric known as customer acquisition cost, or CAC.

#### Definition

The customer acquisition cost (CAC) is the cost a business incurs to acquire a new customer that will buy their product(s) and/or service(s). The CAC is specifically related to expenses in areas such as sales and marketing.

#### CAC Challenges

While acquiring customers is the basis of the economic activity of businesses, they should still carefully balance their CAC expenses to maintain their financial resilience and long-term profitability. This task can be trickier than it appears, though.

On one hand, businesses that restrain themselves from incurring CAC costs too much are more likely to miss out on many potential customers that might bring them a solid return in profits in the future. On the other hand, businesses that don’t attempt to control their CAC at all can end up with expenses that could otherwise easily be avoided, leading to decreases in their profitability and, in the worst-case scenario, even bankruptcy.

With this in mind, finding the right balance for their CAC expenses is of utmost priority to every successful business. However, this is often a difficult task, requiring insights and experience to determine which expenses bring the most in terms of investment return, and which ones are to be reduced or omitted instead.

### CAC and CLV

A metric that CAC is usually compared to is the [customer’s lifetime value](https://exponea.com/blog/customer-lifetime-value-guide/), or CLV (also sometimes referred to as LTV or CLTV), which determines how much value (measured in terms of [net profit](https://www.glew.io/guides/net-profit-calculate)) a customer brings to a business throughout their dealings with them.

Businesses measure the CAC to CLV ratio to determine how cost-effective their acquisition strategy is. A lower CAC to higher CLV ratio is what businesses strive for in this situation, as they aim to spend less in terms of acquisition-related expenses without lowering the value they get from the customers acquired in the process.

However, this doesn’t mean that a CAC higher than its respective CLV spells disaster. In fact, CAC values often fluctuate, and they’re especially likely to be high for start-up businesses, which isn’t reason enough for too much concern in itself. In any case, businesses need to comprehend the reasons behind higher CAC values if they’re to lower them in the future and ensure ideal profitability.

#### How Is CAC Calculated

To calculate their CAC for a particular time frame, businesses first need to determine the sum of all expenses for acquiring customers (in most cases, this includes sales and marketing expenses) for the time period in question and divide it by the sum of customers acquired for the same time period. With this in mind, the formula for calculating CAC will be as follows:

**Total marketing and sales costs / Number of customers acquired = CAC**

To illustrate this with an example, let’s say that during the past month, a business has spent a total of **\$55,000** on all cumulative expenses in their marketing and sales departments that work to attract customers and sell them products and/or services. During the same month, this business has managed to acquire **1000** customers. Their CAC for the month will, therefore, be $55 for that particular month, calculated as follows:

**\$55,000 / 1000 = $55**

#### Why Is CAC Important

For businesses, their CAC is an important indicator of the profitability of their customer acquisition strategy in the long run, and consequently, of their own commercial success in the future.

While the CAC provides a significant insight into the overall business health, it’s important to note that this metric gets more relevant as time passes, and is perhaps not so much so for businesses that have recently begun operating. In reality, in the first days, weeks, and in some cases, even months, businesses should treat their CACs as an investment. Usually, customers won’t immediately be attracted to buy a product or service from a very recently established business, so such a business should not expect immediate returns for some time. After this primary period — provided that the business in question survives it — profits and recovery from the CAC are to be expected. From then on, the CAC itself can be used as an indicator of the business’s success at attracting customers.

As time passes, businesses should gain more and more insights into how their CAC fluctuates and what causes these fluctuations, enabling them to optimize it and ensure a much higher CLV value when acquiring new customers. As a rule of thumb, an ideal CLV to CAC ratio should be [3:1](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/kpi-examples/saas-metrics/customer-lifetime-value) — that is, for every dollar invested in attracting a customer, the business should get 3 dollars from said customer.

CAC is an especially indicative metric in the [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/) economy, which functions based on businesses selling software as a subscription to their [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client). As subscriptions come in the form of long term, periodical payments of usually the same amount of money on a regular (commonly monthly or yearly) basis, SaaS businesses will usually spare no quarter to gain as many customers or clients as they possibly can, since the [return on investment](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/roi-return-on-investment-1794432) can be very promising. Knowing how to properly manage their CAC expenses can be crucial for these businesses’ profitability, especially in terms of curbing excess costs that, due to their repeatable nature, can have a significant impact on their budget.

#### Summary

Customer acquisition cost, or CAC, is the amount of money it takes for a business to acquire a new customer. The CAC is commonly calculated as the sum of a business’s expenses in sales and marketing for a particular time period, divided by the number of customers it acquired for the same period.

Finding the proper balance in CAC can be a challenging task. On the one hand, businesses that restrict themselves when spending on customer acquisition can miss out on opportunities to gain particular customers, and on the other hand, those who don’t mind how much they spend may end up with many unnecessary expenses.

CAC is commonly associated with another metric known as customer lifetime value (CLV), which shows businesses how much value each customer brings them. Businesses aim to maintain a CLV higher than the CAC for any single customer, as this would mean that the acquisition is profitable.

A business’s CAC matters more as time goes by since for new businesses it will usually take a while before their CAC investments bear fruit and turn profitable. After a while, businesses can use the knowledge of their CAC fluctuation to ensure a positive CLV to CAC ratio, ideally 3:1.

The CAC metric is particularly interesting to observe in the SaaS economy, as SaaS businesses usually spare no expenses when trying to acquire new customers. These businesses should handle their CAC with extreme care to avoid repetitive unnecessary expenses.

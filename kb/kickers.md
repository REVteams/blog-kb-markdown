# Kickers

## Selling products and/or services makes up the bulk of a business’s economic activity. If a business wants to increase sales, its executives need to keep coming up with new ways to incentivize the members of their sales teams to perform more.

One of the most effective ways to achieve this result is by using kickers.

#### Definition

In sales terminology, kickers — also known as accelerators — are higher [commission](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-commission) rates or bonuses that businesses give to their sales representatives once they achieve (or come close to achieving) a predetermined sales quota. The goal of the use of kickers is to keep productivity high among the sales team. In other words, kickers are used to motivate salespeople to sell more in general or, in some cases, to sell more of a certain product or service in particular. 

#### Why Businesses Use Sales Kickers

Salesperson motivation is a key factor in increasing sales. Businesses use many different methods to increase sales productivity, some more effective than others. This effectiveness depends on a number of factors, such as the business’s implementation strategy as well as the heterogeneity of sales team members. 

As stated by [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/07/motivating-salespeople-what-really-works), the use of multiple kickers can improve sales numbers by up to 17%. Rewarding sales agents with kickers can also diminish the chances of them becoming unmotivated once they achieve or come close to achieving their quota.

As a motivational method in sales, apart from incentivizing sales teams to reach the desired quota, kickers can also be used to motivate salespeople to start selling a different product or service they don’t have experience with. To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a business’s sales team is selling product A, but the executives have developed and started marketing a new product — product B. If they want their salespeople to begin selling product B, they may face the obstacle of unfamiliarity. This stems from the fact that salespeople are used to selling product A, and selling product B would be less comfortable for them since they don’t have experience with it. In such a situation, a kicker can be used to motivate them to start selling product B. 

With a proper [business model](https://articles.bplans.com/what-is-a-business-model-business-models-explained/), sales kickers inspire sales representatives to achieve and exceed their goals. Without the use of kickers, quotas can have a much lesser financial impact on sales representatives, with the risk of companies underpaying high performers and overpaying those that fail to meet their goals. 

#### How Sales Kickers Work 

Kickers are offered to salespersons that either reach their predetermined sales quota or come near it, as both a reward for [deals closed](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal) and a motivation to perform better. When it comes to how many commission increases kickers can include, kicker plans can be divided into two main models:

* **Single-tier kicker model** — This model gives a single commission increase to salespersons. To demonstrate its functioning with an example, let’s say that a business offers a kicker to one of its sales representatives after having reached 80% of their quota. Let’s say that the salesperson was initially earning 10 cents on each dollar they get from sales. After the quota is met, the salesperson can start earning 20 cents on each dollar they make on all sales above their quota.
* **Multi-tier kicker model** — With this model, the commission increases with the increase of the achieved quota percentage. For example, after a salesperson reaches 80% - 100% of their quota, they would earn a 10% commission. Reaching 100-150% would mean they’ll earn a 20% commission, and so on. In practice, this model usually proves to be more effective than its single-tier counterpart. 

### Effectiveness and Considerations

Multi-tier kicker models are more effective for core and high performers, and less so for lagging performers. They’re clearly more desirable for technology companies because they are better at the management of compensation in general, and they entice and sustain better productivity of their most valuable performers. 

The goal of all kicker models is to use different incentives to get the lagging performers up to a core performer level, especially those performers that respond well to such methods. By gaining insights into where the sales team lacks, as well as by concentrating on leveling up the lagging performers, businesses can increase the advantages of the layered kicker model in their commission plan. 

[TINYpulse](https://www.tinypulse.com/) conducted [research](https://www.teamstrength.net/employee-engagement-surveys/) concluding that 43% of employees would quit their companies if offered only a 10% salary increase elsewhere. It frequently occurs that star performers in sales groups are the ones that obtain most of the revenue, and therefore, the possibility of losing these performers to a higher-paying competitor is a significant risk to each business. For this reason, it’s very important to reward the endeavors of star performers by using methods such as kickers in order to avoid their departure. Kickers should deliver on high-performance motivation and competitive payment for different levels of performance. 

To implement kickers with an effective outcome, businesses should start by clearly determining their commission plan. This would make it easier for members of the sales team to understand how commissions are paid, and they’ll therefore be able to increase their focus on achieving their quotas. This generates higher work consistency. 

An additional thing for businesses to consider is the quota threshold. Whether businesses plan to award commissions before or after the quota threshold is met, deciding on the threshold itself will have an effect on salesperson motivation. Uncapped commission, which is sometimes applied in large deals, can be massively demotivating in the sales group, and it’s usually better to avoid it. 

Apart from kickers acting as sales accelerators, businesses can also use decelerators — that is, penalties for sales representatives who do not reach their quotas. Furthermore, businesses can also apply [clawbacks](https://rev.team/kb/clawback), which are punitive measures that force salespersons to give their pre-paid commissions back in case they don’t reach their quotas. In such cases, businesses need to consider the difficulty of clawing back commissions at the amount they were awarded, and the ripple effects on formerly awarded bonuses which have proven ineffective.

#### Summary

Sales kickers or accelerators are a method for incentivizing sales representatives to sell more.  Kickers are higher commission rates that are rewarded to members of sales teams when they reach a certain quota — or just before they reach it — in order to motivate them to sell more and achieve their goals.

Sales kickers can also be used to motivate members of sales teams to sell a different product or service than the one they are already working with. As sales representatives usually feel more at ease with selling items they’re used to, kickers can give them an incentive to engage in selling something they’re less experienced with.

Depending on how many commission increases a business’s plan offers its salespersons, kickers can be given out through either single-tier or multi-tier kicker models. In practice, multi-tier models are often more effective compared to single-tier ones. Multi-layered kickers are especially more desirable for technology companies, as they help them reward their highest-performing sales employees more easily. 

Sales kickers are usually more effective with core and high-performing employees. High-performing employees are the ones that bring in most of the revenue. Sales executives need to be aware of their team’s heterogeneity and focus on leveling up the lagging performers, which kickers are most effective at. 

A good commission plan can prevent high performers from leaving the company since it has been shown that many employees would quit their current company for just a 10% raise in salary offered by a different employer. 

When implementing a sales kicker model, businesses should keep several things in mind for their kicker plans to result in success, including setting a clear commission plan, quota thresholds, uncapped commissions, decelerators, and clawbacks.

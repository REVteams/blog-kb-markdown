Because of the importance of sales to a business’s health, as well as the ever-increasing competition on the market, businesses have to constantly come up with novel ways to drive sales throughout their lifetime. One such way is by offering discounts to customers and [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client).

#### Definition

A discount is a promotional price reduction of products or services sold by a business. Discounts can be introduced by businesses as a strategy to make their items easier to sell, by using the price reduction to attract more buyers and help them decide on a purchase. The primary purpose of discounts is to drive sales, which in turn increases profits for a business.

#### How Are Discounts Used 

Businesses can decide to offer discounts at any point of the distribution channel — whether it’s lowering the original price that the manufacturer or producer sets, the price determined by a wholesaler or retailer, the list price indicated to potential buyers, or any other price along the line. 

Introducing discounts can be useful for businesses for various purposes. Some of these include:

* Selling products that are nearing their expiry date, or in some cases, even products that have already expired;
* Driving short-term sales for products and services that have a discount only for a particular, usually short period of time;
* Rewarding faithful clients or customers with decreased prices;
* Motivating particular actors within the distribution channel to perform certain actions;
* Promoting particular products or services that the business is selling;
* Gaining new customers;
* And more.

The extent and the purpose of using discounts vary from business to business depending on various factors such as the sectors they operate in, their size, individual decisions by their sales teams and owners, and so on.

#### Discount Types

There are different ways in which businesses can offer discounts to their customers or clients. All the different discount types are differentiated on several bases, such as the way buyers pay for products or services, the quantities they buy, their personal characteristics, and so on.

### Payment Method Discounts

The payment method discount has to do with the way buyers pay businesses. A common discount of this type is when businesses offer a lower price to those buyers that are willing to pay with cash instead of a credit card. In this way, businesses avoid the credit card usage fees they’d otherwise have to deduce from their profits upon each payment.

### Seasonal Discounts

These are discounts that buyers buying within a particular time frame (a season) can benefit from, usually when buying products or services considered out-of-season. A very common example of a seasonal discount would be end-of-quarter discounts. Different kinds of companies — and particularly those using the [SaaS](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/saas-10-faqs-software-service/) model — report on quarterly earnings at the end of each quarter, and it’s in their best interest to show growth on these reports (especially for the final, fourth quarter). For this reason, their sales teams are likely to offer buyers end-of-quarter seasonal discounts to [close more deals](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal).

### Short-Term Discounts

Similar to seasonal discounts, short-term discounts can be applied to products or services being sold during a particular period. The difference between these two discount types is that the short-term discount is applied to a much shorter period, usually weeks, days, or sometimes even hours — which is notably the case with [happy hours](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/word-history-of-happy-hour).

### Bargaining Discounts

In some cases, usually for larger and more costly purchases, customers can bargain with businesses asking them to lower the price somewhat. Such bargaining discounts, should they occur, are usually allowed by businesses as a way to appease their customers into buying a product or service they’d otherwise consider too expensive. However, this practice is less common, and when it is, it’s mostly done on a very unofficial level.

### Quantity Discounts

It’s common practice for businesses to give out discounts to buyers who buy larger amounts at once. This practice is also known as [bulk purchasing](https://www.business-to-you.com/terms/bulk-purchasing/). For example, software selling SaaS companies can offer their buyers discounts for purchasing multiple licenses at once.

The reason behind lowering prices during these exchanges is that businesses can profit from [economies of scale](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/economics/economies-of-scale/) — that is, by immediately cashing in extra profits based on the larger quantities sold, wherein the margin they lose because of the discount is neglectable.

### Employee Discounts

Businesses can sometimes give discounts on products or services sold to their employees. This can be a great way to reward employees for their services and increase their loyalty to their employers, too.

### Age-Related Discounts

Some businesses give discounts to particular age groups. A notable example of such discounts is when businesses give parents a discount for buying services for their toddler children, commonly in use by transportation and accommodation providers. Such discounts can also be given to young people below a certain age as well as seniors above a certain age.

### Discounts for Particular Groups

In some cases, businesses give discounts to members of particular groups. A common example of this practice are discounts given to people with disabilities. Other examples include discounts given to students, military staff, and so on.

### Functional Discounts

These discounts can be given out in the form of payments to particular members within the distribution channel for performing particular actions. For example, a manufacturer can give a wholesaler a discount for storing their products in a warehouse or transporting them.

#### Summary

A discount is a promotional price reduction for products or services. Businesses give out discounts to drive sales and gain new customers, which will ultimately increase their income.

Businesses can give out discounts on all levels of the distribution channels, from the manufacturing price to the retail price and everywhere in between.

Discounts can be used for many different purposes, such as selling products just before (or just after) their expiry date, driving short-term sales, rewarding faithful customers, motivating distribution channel members to perform particular actions, gaining customers, and more. 

There are many different types of discounts that businesses usually give out based on payment type, purchase quantity, the type of buyers paying for the products or services, and so on. Some common discount types include payment method discounts, seasonal discounts, short-term discounts, bargaining discounts, quantity discounts, employee discounts, age-related discounts, discounts for particular groups, functional discounts, and more.

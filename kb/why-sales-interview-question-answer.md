You should have a three-minute answer. To help you prepare for the interview, you may wish to create a draft. BUT don't memorize it. You should focus on the key points. What motivates you? How does this job fulfill that?

Practice your response with a friend or alone after you have developed it. You will feel more confident and prepared for the interview if you practice alone. A friend can conduct a mock interview to give you feedback on your responses.

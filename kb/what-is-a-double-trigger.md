# What is a Double Trigger?

## When it comes to compensating employees, companies can use a variety of different methods in addition to paying them salaries.

One such method — particularly popular as an option for retirement plans and as a means to give out shares to employees is known as [vesting](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/vesting/). Except as a way to compensate employees, vesting is also widely used in the real estate sector. 

Vesting designates a specific point in time after which individuals (commonly company employees or real estate buyers) get to benefit from their rights and interests that arise from their legal ownership of a property (such as company stocks, real estate, and so on). In company business practice, vesting as a form of employee compensation comes after a particular time interval during which employees have to work for the company to be able to benefit from the ownership of the asset they have a vested right to. 

Companies (especially startups) usually promote vested ownership of shares in this way and have means of accelerating the vesting procedure for their employees. This acceleration can be done in several ways, but most commonly through triggers — either a single trigger or a double trigger.

#### Definition

Double-trigger is a clause that uses two separate causes to fully or partially accelerate the vesting of company options or stocks. These two causes act as triggers that cause the acceleration of the vesting, which is why the name double-trigger is used to describe this scenario.

#### Why Companies Accelerate Vesting

Double-triggers are related to vesting acceleration, which is a process that allows a company’s employees to speed up their vesting period. The vesting period is a determined amount of time after which employees gain the rights stemming from ownership of property (such as company stocks in most cases). 

A company can accelerate vesting to reward those employees it values most. It can also use vesting acceleration as an outward signal towards potential acquirers, making itself more attractive for purchase by other companies who might be interested in acquiring it. 

The practice of accelerating vesting as a means to attract acquirers is particularly used by startups. To demonstrate this with an example, let’s say that a larger, more established company is in the process of acquiring a startup. This startup has a stock vesting period for its employees set on two years, and one year has already passed by the time the larger company becomes interested in the purchase. In this case, the startup can include a provision in its option plans that specifies that if a company takes over the startup, the vesting of the stocks will be accelerated and they’ll become fully vested for the employees at that point. This motivates employees to stay with the startup even after it has passed in the hands of the larger company.

#### How Double-Trigger Vesting Acceleration Works

Companies can use different kinds of vesting acceleration provisions for their employees, but trigger provisions are the most commonly used. A trigger vesting acceleration happens when there has been a triggering event. 

For the two most common trigger acceleration provisions, single-trigger and double-trigger, the most common trigger is the acquisition of the company in question (usually a startup) by another company. Another very common trigger is the event of the company letting an employee go against their own will, commonly 9 to 18 months after closing and after the company’s acquisition by another one. Here, both the termination of an employee with or without good cause can be considered a trigger, depending on the decision of individual companies.

A single-trigger vesting acceleration provision implies only one trigger, usually one of the two mentioned above. On the other hand, double-trigger vesting acceleration happens when two events have been triggered, usually a combination of the abovementioned — a company acquisition as well as the involuntary termination of an employee’s contract.

The main logic behind this most common kind of double-trigger vesting acceleration is useful for protecting key employees from removal by the company’s new owners. Double-trigger vesting acceleration also reduces dilution from automatic acceleration as well as any concerns the acquiring company might have over the requirements of maintaining employee service for them to be able to vest.

Because of this, double-trigger acceleration is much more popular than its single-trigger counterpart for both companies introducing it as well as their employees, especially in a startup environment. 

However, for a double-trigger acceleration to work after the company’s acquisition, an acquirer must maintain the same option grant of the company they’re buying. This isn’t always the case, as acquiring companies often have different plans on how to reward their employees and are thus likely to discontinue those of the company they’re buying.

#### Summary

Double-trigger acceleration is a kind of vesting acceleration that necessitates two separate events to activate itself. These two events are considered triggers for the vesting acceleration, which is why it’s called double-trigger acceleration.

The double-trigger is a type of trigger-based vesting acceleration that’s most commonly used, along with its single-trigger counterpart. Vesting is the period after which company employees can benefit from their rights of property, usually related to owning company stocks. Companies use vesting acceleration as a means of rewarding their most valuable employees for their service.

During trigger-based vesting acceleration, the most commonly used triggers are company acquisition and involuntary employee termination. Single-trigger vesting acceleration usually uses one of these two, while double-trigger acceleration usually uses both. In this way, companies that opt for double-trigger vesting acceleration protect their employees from being terminated by the new company owners after an acquisition.

Because of the safety it provides, double-trigger vesting acceleration is a favorite among both companies and their employees. However, sometimes the acquirers don’t continue with the same option grant of the company they’re acquiring, which usually happens because the new company owners have a different idea of how to reward their employees. In such cases, employees won’t be able to effectively benefit from the double-trigger vesting acceleration provision they agreed upon with the company before the acquisition.

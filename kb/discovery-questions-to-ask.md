### What is a Discovery Call?

A discovery call is the first phone call a sales representative makes with a prospect after having previously connected and established a primary contact with them in any way.

#### What to do before a Discovery Call?

It doesn't begin when you pick up your phone. It begins well before that...

**Make an agenda.**
An agenda is a written outline of the meeting. An agenda is used by salespeople to prepare materials for meetings by describing the flow and topics. Typical agendas include information such as:

Date & Time
Agenda & Call Structure
Discovery Questions
Q&A

An agenda is more than just a plan for your meeting. An agenda shows that you value their time and are willing to work efficiently.

This initial gesture of consideration can improve your brand's professionalism, and create an atmosphere that fosters mutual respect between everyone.

**Concentrate on the pain points.**
It's important to find out as much information as possible about their main concerns. Ask them to describe their problems, and figure out what their goals are, in their career and at their current company.

This will help you understand their motivations and determines if you can help. 

**Ask questions.**
Ask questions throughout the call to clarify points, explore new topics, and gain a better understanding of your customer's needs. Ask about their mission and values to make sure they are aligned with yours, so you can work together.

**Don't be an expert.**
Never get on a discovery call and talk about your product, your company, or you. They don't care. This call is all about them. You can't learn about them if you're talking. 

Customers may not always be able to identify their primary problems or how a product or service can help them, but they do know that they are facing a challenge. Don't get off the call until you fully understand their primary problems and challenges.

**Get a commitment.** 
Some prospects will want to work with you immediately after your discovery call, while others may need additional time. Don't get off the phone until you get a firm yes or no. Don't take "I'll get back to you." as an answer.

#### Provide next steps.

It is important to establish clear expectations for the next steps. Give them the next steps and schedule a follow-up call.

**Know when to cut them loose.** 
If their company's values, budgets, or concerns are not aligned with your company's mission it is a good idea to move on. 

Tell them that at this time "We aren't a good fit." 

If you think of a solution that isn't your company, product or service, share it with them. You want to be considered a trusted advisor, not a sleazy sales rep. 

### How to Ask the Right Questions

The key to a successful discovery call is asking the right questions. It allows you to maximize your learning process about the prospect. Here are some suggestions for questions to ask during discovery sessions:

**Consider Their Pain Points**
Ask questions that fully explore the prospect's concerns to better understand them. You will have fewer questions and concerns later if you know more about the prospect's needs. This helps you build trust and engage the prospect.

**Keep Questions Short**
Shorter questions can have a greater impact and result in a better quality response. Consider the following question: "I see you're facing difficulties. Can you tell me about the challenges you faced, what you would like us to do and how you envision your outcome?"

#### What Discovery Questions Should You Ask and Why?

What should you ask during a discovery call? How can you direct the conversation to a sale? Here are some discovery questions that you should ask during a discovery call.

**"Why" Questions**

Lisa Schnare, a sales development consultant, stated in an interview that your prospect won't give every SDR who reaches out to her 15 minutes of their time. Remember, they agreed to your discovery session for a reason.

*What made you fill out the form on our website?*
*What made you want to book this call?*
*What made you want to speak to us?*
*How did you find us?*

These questions can help you determine urgency and timing. If this is an outbound lead that you have been trying to book for some time, what made them want to speak with you now? Is there a greater urgency on their end now?

**Qualification Questions**
The biggest reason for a discovery call is to find out if they are a good fit, do they match your Ideal Customer Profile?

These questions can also be helpful if your team has multiple customer profiles. This will help you to fit the prospect into a profile that best describes their situation. 

*How many people work in your company or on a particular team?*
*Who are your main customers?*
*What are the goals of your company for this quarter, and this year?*
*What are the goals of your team?*
*What are you doing to reach these goals?*
*How are industry trends and global events affecting your company & team?*
*What problems are you trying to solve?*
*What do YOU like or dislike most about the current approach of your company?*
*Who else is involved with these types of purchase decisions?*

Tailor the questions you plan to ask to your customer profiles and the information that you need to determine if the prospect is a good match.

**Open-Ended Questions**

While asking the surface questions such as the ones mentioned above is important, it's also important to ask deeper questions that will help you see the underside of the conversation.

These questions are usually open-ended and invite the prospect to give more information about their situation.

*Show me how your team does [x]...*
*What is your typical process for [completing this task]*
*Tell me more about...*

These questions indicate that you expect a long answer from your prospect and allow them to be open. Gong research has shown that long customer responses have a direct effect on success rates in discovery calls.

The more you can get your prospects talking during the call, the better!

### Summary

The ability to ask the proper questions is essential for a successful discovery meeting. This will help to ensure that the meeting moves forward and is productive. It also allows you to get the most out of your discovery process by making the most of every opportunity.

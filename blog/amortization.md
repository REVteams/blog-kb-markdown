# Amortization

Amortization

Companies often possess intangible assets — non-physical resources that have a long-term value — such as patents, trademarks, and licenses. These help them protect their intellectual property and conduct business in accordance with legal requirements.

Such intangible assets are obtained at a cost, though, which can sometimes be too big for developing businesses. For these reasons, companies are often prone to a process in accounting called amortization, which helps them lower their taxable income for the course of the duration of their intangible assets.

## Definition

In accounting, the term amortization designates a company’s plan to spread payment over a certain period of time. The **amortization period** ends by a certain date, designed by the company’s amortization schedule.

Except for intangible assets, for which the term amortization is used most commonly, another thing that companies can amortize is their loans.

## Intangible Assets Amortization

The value of intangible assets can lower with the passing of time (much like that of tangible assets). In this sense, amortizing intangible assets is used by companies to quantify the assets’ value throughout their useful life for the needs of accounting and dealing with taxes.

Here, the term amortization, used for intangible assets, is similar to the terms **deprecation** (which refers to tangible assets) and **depletion** (used for natural resources).

Amortization for intangible assets is usually set to be paid each month, in equal monthly amounts. As it is a payment over time, amortization commonly includes interest rates as well.

### Recording Intangible Asset Amortization

To calculate the expenses for intangible asset amortization and write it down in their accounting books, companies start by determining the asset:

* **Initial value.** Determining an intangible asset’s initial value can be a hard task. Companies usually employ accountants or legal professionals to do this for them.
* **Lifespan.** When talking about intangible assets, like patents and trademarks, companies amortize them until they expire.
* **Residual value.** This is the asset’s value after the moment when the company stops using it. Assets lose value over time, so by the time they’re out of use, they may even have no value left whatsoever.

Having these determined, the company can then calculate amortization expenses by subtracting the residual value from the initial value, and then dividing the result by the lifespan. If the company determines the asset has no residual value, then the equation is much simpler: it just requires dividing the initial value by the lifespan.

After calculating it in this way, companies write down amortization expenses under the **depreciation and amortization** line item in the income statement.

### What Intangible Asset Amortization Looks Like

For example, a company may have a license on one of its products, which expires in 5 years. Initially, designing and producing this product cost the company $20,000.

The company will then divide the initial cost by the lifespan (\$20,000 divided by 5 years) and write down $4,000 as a yearly amortization expense for the license.

## Loan Amortization

The other use of the term amortization is related to loans. In this sense, it designates paying off loans in several instances during a designated time period called a **loan period.**

In accounting, companies record every single payment as an expense, instead of the total loan expenses.

### Loan Period Length

As loans also have interest rates, it’s important to take the length of the amortization period into account.

* Shorter amortization periods come with a lower interest total in the long run. In this case, however, companies pay more each month, because for each payment they have to return larger parts of the **principal** — that is, the primary amount of the loan without calculating interest.
* Longer amortization periods mean that companies pay a higher total interest, and in turn, they pay less each month.

Whenever possible, companies will choose shorter amortization periods if they can afford to pay more each month, and longer ones if they can’t afford short-term costs.

### What Loan Amortization Looks Like

For example, a company has a loan of \$4,000 it needs to pay off in two years. This means that it has to pay $2,000 of the loan principal, plus interest, each year.

In this case, the company will record a yearly loan amortization of $2,000 in their books. Interests don’t fall under the amortization category here.

## The Importance of Amortization

Companies are serious about calculating amortization because it allows them to have a better insight into their expenses as time passes.

When it comes to intangible assets, calculating their amortization is very important for companies. It can help companies pay fewer taxes by lowering their taxable income. It also helps investors get a better grasp of how much the company really earns.

Calculating amortization for paying off loans is also very helpful for companies. Loan amortization schedules can help companies understand and compare the loan principle to the interest for each payment. In this way, they can exempt the interest from their taxes as well.

## Summary

In accounting, amortization is a technique that companies use to stretch a payment over a certain time period, as well as to minimize book values in order to lower their taxable income. The term is mainly used in two ways: for intangible assets and loans.

Amortization of intangible assets over a set period of time requires some calculations. The companies need to determine the assets’ initial value, lifespan, and residual value (if any) to determine the amortization required and write it down in their books.

When it comes to loan amortization, companies should pay attention to the loan payment periods. Shorter periods imply lower interest totals at the expense of increased monthly payments, whereas for longer periods, it’s the other way around.

Calculating amortization is important for companies to gain a better insight into their future expenses.

These targeted approaches to selling are sweeping over the B2B sector with a promise of growing revenues, producing higher win rates, and getting bigger deals.

### What Are Account-Based Sales Development (ABSD) and Account-Based Sales (ABS)?

Account-Based Sales (ABS) and Account-Based Sales Development (ABSD) are strategic sales approaches that include prospecting, qualifying, and closing of individual, high-value accounts. Account-based sales strategies, such as ABS and ABSD treat every account as a market of one, so rather than one sales rep targeting a single business contact, a whole team is committed to targeting many stakeholders at the prospective client.

Specifically, account-based sales development is a strategy where sales development reps are prospecting into a limited number of pre-qualified accounts simultaneously. On the other hand, account-based selling is a multi-channel sales tactic coordinated across several teams at the company level targeting high-value accounts. Similar to other account-based approaches, the renewed interest in ABSD and ABS is propelled by the improved functionality of CRM technologies that improve their efficiency and scalability.

### Account-Based Sales & Account-Based Sales Development: Are They the Same?

Account-Based Sales (ABS) and Account-Based Sales Development (ABSD), as their titles suggest, are both account-based models that, together with Account-Based Marketing (ABM) follow a relatively similar approach. However, there is some confusion about the exact meaning of account-based sales (ABS) and account-based sales development (ABSD), especially if and how they differ and their exact purpose. Before we dive into how sales and sales development are different, it is important to consider how they are related first.

#### Similarities between ABS and ABSD

Account-based approaches often strive for collaboration between different business units of a company and ABS and ABSD are no exception. When it comes to account-based sales and sales development there is a high level of teamwork between sales, marketing, and business development teams to secure targeted, individual accounts with a proposition that corresponds to that client's unique needs. In fact, it is essential to highlight that both sales and sales development focuses on driving sales and increasing revenue. In that sense, the roles of a sales development and a sales representative are complementary. However, when the sales process steps are factored in, the distinction between them becomes more apparent.

#### Differences between ABS and ABSD

On the one hand, account-based sales development is more concentrated on the earlier stages of the sales cycle. More precisely, ABSD deals with qualifying leads, i.e. working out if a lead meets the requirements for buying whatever the company is selling. This is a necessary function in the sales cycle as it helps companies save time and money on pursuing leads that aren't in a position to purchase. In addition to qualifying leads, the role of ABSD is to identify opportunities, cold call and set appointments for sales teams when the right opportunities emerge. Sales development representatives handle the initial stages of the sales cycle, and they don't focus on closing deals. The primary concern for sales development representatives is the pipeline and keeping it packed.

Sales development shifts the traditional role of sales. Companies with sales development and sales as separate business functions see sales teams perform in a redefined capacity. For instance, sales teams have less or no focus on prospecting. Similarly, sales reps are more focused on building relationships, presentations, and product demonstrations, while ultimately, the end goal is to uncover the client's needs, propose solutions, and close deals. In practice, the collaborative effort between sales and sales development teams plays out in a streamlined strategy aimed at propelling deal closing.

### What Are the Benefits of Account-Based Sales Development or Sales?

Sales performance depends on many factors, such as the type of software and tools used by sales teams, the overall organizational capacities, and the company's relative position in an industry's value chain. 

Nevertheless, adopting an account-based approach to sales (standalone or in combination with other sales strategies) can enable teams to power up their sales process and yield better results. These are the most important advantages of using account-based sales:

#### In-depth focus on high-value prospects

Going after a handful of high-value accounts gives sales teams the freedom to perform in-depth research about clients and their needs. This, in turn, contributes to creating highly personalized messaging that can lead to a higher close rate.

#### Strategic sales process planning

ABS doesn't prioritize volume, allowing sales teams to take a step back and strategically plan out every step in the process.

#### Better performance insight

With a shorter list of accounts to track, sales teams can process key data more easily and get a better insight into what’s working and what isn’t.

### How to Measure the Success of Account-Based Sales?

Companies that introduce ABS as a primary sales approach must track and measure success to make needed changes and continuously upgrade. An excellent way to monitor success is to record and benchmark against the following KPIs actively. These are the essential KPIs for measuring account-based sales success:

**Connect Rate** represents the proportion of all accounts that get significantly involved in a sales conversation. A solid connect rate, generally accepted across industries, should range between 30% and 35%. Connect rate reflects the fraction of prospected accounts that engage in a meaningful sales conversation.

**Pass Rate** is the proportion of all prospected accounts that result in a qualified lead. The number of qualified leads being passed on to the sales team to accept or reject their sales process should average above 10%.

**Pipeline Rate** reflects the percentage of leads that are admitted into a sales cycle and should usually average above 70%.

### Summary

The key takeaways for account-based selling (ABS) and sales development (ABSD) are that both sales strategies rely on a personal and targeted approach to selling and that they treat every account as a market of one. As such, getting ahead with ABS and ABSD requires a joint effort from multiple teams across a company to target multiple stakeholders at the prospective clients.

Nonetheless, ABS and ABSD can enable teams to power up their sales process and yield better results.

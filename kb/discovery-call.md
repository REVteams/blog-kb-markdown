One of the steps sales professionals may have to make on the way to converting prospects into customers is to have a discovery call with them.

The discovery call is the most important step in your relationship with a prospect. This step is essential for the sales process and also outlines all future steps.

More than 50% of your prospects don't fit the criteria for what you are selling. This means that if you don't properly qualify your prospects in the discovery call, you're wasting time.

### Definition

A discovery call is the first phone call a sales representative makes with a prospect after having previously connected and established a primary contact with them in any way. The aim of the discovery call is to further familiarize the salesperson with the particular prospect they’re calling to ultimately determine how likely it is to convert this prospect into a paying [customer](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) and [client](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client).

What is the goal for your first call? You'll need to listen to your prospect and find out their goals.

We repeat:

#### A discovery call is NOT about selling your product or services.
#### It's all about THEM. 

Think of yourself like a doctor *diagnosing a problem* instead of being that annoying vendor trying to sell anything to anyone who passes by their booth in the mall.

This exception applies only to warm leads (or referral leads) and leads who initiate contact with your company. Discovery should be done slowly because trust is built over *time*. And it takes time to understand your prospect's problems and concerns. 

### Discovery Call vs Cold Call vs Warm Call

As a sales practice, discovery calling is often compared to the similar concepts of [cold calling](https://rev.team/kb/cold-call) and warm calling. For one thing, cold calling works by following a somewhat different principle. The prospects that salespeople cold call have had no previous contact with them or the business they work for whatsoever. The sales team usually finds prospects to cold call through researching databases and determining which ones are most suitable to be converted, but in any case, the cold call is the very first contact they have with these prospects.

This is what makes cold calls different from discovery calls — the latter is made when a contact has already been established with a prospect and now the salesperson is calling them to try to figure out whether they’re good candidates for conversion. In some cases, the cold call could be the primary contact a salesperson makes with a prospect, which would later be followed by a discovery call after the prospect will have shown some interest in potentially buying the products or services the salesperson had talked to them about.

In this sense, discovery calls are much more similar to warm calls, which are, by definition, calls that salespersons make with leads and prospects they’ve already contacted before. In fact, in some cases, the terms discovery call and warm call are used as synonyms. In other cases, discovery calls are considered a kind of warm call. The most commonly established difference between the two is that a discovery call is considered to be only the first call a salesperson makes after having previously contacted a prospect, whereas a warm call could be any call they make with any prospect, lead, customer, or even client — in essence, anyone they’ve already established some kind of a relationship with.

### How Discovery Calls Work

Sales professionals don’t always try to start selling their products or services to prospects during discovery calls. This is because the main focus of making a discovery call is to determine whether a commercial relationship with a particular prospect is a viable option worth their time and effort. If the discovery call shows that a prospect can be converted into a paying customer, there will be many opportunities to close sales with them further down the line. 

Discovery calls are a great way for all members of a sales team (and the business they work for) to familiarize themselves with the needs and goals of their prospects. This knowledge can help them establish a better rapport with them and ultimately increase the chances of converting them into paying customers.

The discovery call process consists of the following steps: research, qualification, identifying pain points, providing solutions, and a call to action.

#### Research

Sales professionals prepare themselves well before initiating a discovery call. They do this by researching as much as possible, within a reasonable timeframe, about the prospects they’re about to call. They can do this by gathering their personal information from their websites, social media profiles, the business’s databases containing previously gathered information on them, and so on.  

#### Qualification

After having prepared for it, salespersons initiate the discovery call and begin by asking their prospects qualifying questions. These questions are meant to reveal information about the prospect that’s relevant to the sales process. 

For example, a sales professional can ask their prospect about their existing relationship with (and usage of) the kind of products or services they’d be selling to them, how it impacts their life or work, what made them choose the products/services they’ve used in the past, what’s their current budget for new ones, and so on.  

#### Identifying Problems or Pain Points

At this point, sales professionals would be well into a conversation with their prospects to be able to determine their [pain points](https://www.commbox.io/the-complete-guide-to-customer-pain-points/) or problems. Experienced sales professionals will often be able to show their prospects some pain points they have without being aware of it themselves.

This can be achieved by asking prospects some [open-ended sales questions](https://spotio.com/blog/open-ended-sales-questions/), such as what challenges they’re facing in their life or at work, what’s preventing them from achieving their goals, how important it is for them to achieve said goals, how much time they usually spend on working with products or services they’ve been previously using, and so on. 

#### Providing Solutions to the Problems

After pointing out their prospects’ pain points or problems, the next step salespersons make is to show them how the products or services they’re offering would help them solve these problems. This can be done by pointing out the benefits of using a product/service their business is offering, how using these would help the prospects improve their productivity, how it would bring them closer to achieving their goals, how much money it would save them, and so on.

#### Call to Action

Finally, after showing prospects how their products or services can make their work (or life in general) easier for them, salespersons conclude the discovery call by inviting the prospects to take the next step. 

This can be done, for example, by sending them a follow-up e-mail they’re expected to reply to, offering them a product or service demo, arranging another meeting to discuss further cooperation (or even a possible purchase), and so on.

### Summary

A discovery call is the first phone call a salesperson makes with a prospect after having previously established contact with them. Salespersons initiate discovery calls to determine whether individual prospects are likely to be converted into paying customers of the business they work for.

Discovery calls are often compared to the similar concepts of cold and warm calls. Cold calls are a somewhat different concept because they’re made without any previous contact with the prospect in question. Warm calls, on the other hand, are much more similar to discovery calls since they’re made with previously contacted prospects — the difference being that a discovery call is usually narrowly defined as a very first call happening after having contacted a prospect, whereas warm calls can include any call to any previously contacted prospect, lead, or even customer.

Discovery calls are an excellent opportunity for salespersons to get insights into the goals and needs of their prospects, which can help them establish a better relationship and bring their prospects closer to converting. The process of making a discovery call goes through the following stages: research, qualification, identifying prospect problems or pain points, providing solutions to these problems, and a call to action.

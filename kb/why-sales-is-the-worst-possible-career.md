# Why Sales is the Worst Possible Career?

## Why is sales the worst possible career? You are not alone in asking this question. There are many reasons to choose a career as a salesperson, but there are also reasons you might want to consider other career options.

Interviewing a variety of salespeople from different industries would likely yield a wide range of answers. It can be difficult to get into sales. Many people, even those who initially were reluctant, end up with long, successful careers as salespeople.

There are many great reasons to get into sales. However, there are also some very bad reasons. These "wrong" reasons are why far too many people try sales, leading to burnout, disappointment, and high turnover.

If you are considering a job in sales for any of these reasons, you might want to rethink your decision.

### Reasons Why A Career in Sales is the Worst

#### 1. Freedom?

Some sales jobs allow people to be free, but there is a catch. There are two. The first is that the jobs that offer total freedom will only pay commissions.

This means that you won't get paid unless you work hard. If "freedom" means that you can spend your days at the beach, you won’t get a salary. Two: While there are jobs in sales that provide recurring revenue, which can allow you to relax and answer calls occasionally while earning a great income, it takes many years of hard work to build the customer base.

There are no shortcuts in sales, as in life.

#### 2. Good Money?

Sales is a good choice for those who want to make a living. However, the desire to make money is not enough. There are certainly people who are so desperate for money that they will turn themselves into machines and only need a large commission or bonus check to keep working.

Most people want to find fulfillment in other ways. They need to have a purpose beyond the monthly direct deposit. If you are like most people, the only reason you want to work in sales is to make money, especially when it gets difficult.

#### 3. "Outgoing" Personality?

There are a lot of charismatic, outgoing people out there who think they can make great salespeople. But then they find themselves being spit out by a profession that requires more than just personality to succeed. It's hard work.

To survive in sales, you need to put in the effort, manage stress, be creative, and have thick skin. Before you assume that sales are a natural fit for you, charismatic people should speak to someone in sales about the day-to-day realities of the job. Then, humble yourself before taking on the challenge.

#### 4. Stable Paycheck?

A skilled salesperson should indeed be able to earn an above-average income over a year. However, those looking for consistent income stability will find it difficult to work on a quota. There is a middle ground.

Many sales jobs offer a basic salary or a draw to give employees some consistency. Salespeople should be comfortable with uncertainty and variation in their paychecks.

### Sales Careers - The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly

Everyone who has ever considered a career as a salesperson has asked the question: Is it a good career choice?

Sales might not seem like a good career choice due to high turnover rates and reports about burnout on sales floors. This job path has many positives, but there are also some negatives.

Here's everything you need to know about a career as a salesperson.

#### Why Sales is a Great Career Choice

Sales can be a great career. Salespeople can earn a high salary and have a clear career path within the company. Everyone can go into sales.

You only need to be motivated to improve your sales skills and have the desire to succeed.

Here are some reasons why sales is a great career choice:

* **High Pay:** Unless your employer sets a limit on commissions, the sky's the limit. In the right sales role, you can make well over $100K per year.
* **Clear Career Track**: As an entry-level salesperson, you can move up to management or later into business development.
* **Personal Growth Opportunities**: In a sales position, you'll improve your interpersonal and professional skills. You will improve your communication skills and problem-solving abilities by talking to strangers every single day.
* **Always in Demand**: Sales positions are always available and expected to grow. Sales manager positions at the mid-level are growing at 7%, even without accounting for entry-level jobs.
* **Transferable Skills:** Once a sales job is secured, you are ready to do anything. You can use your communication skills for customer service or your product knowledge for marketing.

Selling requires determination, perseverance, and thick skin. Although it can be one of the most rewarding jobs, you will also face rejection.

Not all sales jobs are created equally. Cold calling is a different job than inbound sales. This is because the people you talk to are genuinely interested in the product that you sell.

Cold calling is an essential part of many sales jobs, especially during prospecting, but it shouldn't be the majority of your job or you'll quickly burn out.

Ask specific questions when interviewing for a job in sales. This will help you to understand the employer's sales process. Ask them how they source prospects and how they decide if a prospect is a qualified lead.

Continue looking for a different role if they don't have a clear answer.

#### Pro #1: Your performance is your responsibility.

Salespeople are paid a combination of a base salary and commission. The number of deals you close determines how much you are paid.

While a base salary-commission structure may seem scary to some, great salespeople know that it can be very profitable if they put in the effort to generate new leads and go the extra mile for prospects.

#### Con #1: Poor performance impacts your pay.

Performance in the previous month determines a large portion of their earnings. Your pay will dip from time to time, regardless of whether you are experiencing seasonality in sales cycles or because you didn't close the deals that you were counting on.

Although results can affect compensation in all fields, sales is one profession where a large portion of your salary is directly related to your performance. *What if you have a bad year?*

#### Pro #2: You can choose the best leads.

Top-performing sales reps don’t "spray & pray." You might be tempted, as a new rep, to look at activity levels (calls and emails) to gauge your performance. However, the best salespeople understand that they must balance quality and quantity.

Instead of being at the mercy of 100 random prospects, you might choose to cherry-pick your top 15 or 20 leads. This will allow you to understand the problems of your prospects and offer tailored solutions. Your chances of winning their business are dramatically increased.

#### Con #2: Not all leads will lead to a closed-won deal.

You can send as much information as you like, make as many phone calls, and send as many emails. You can't convince prospects to buy.

#### Pro #3: Success is measurable.

Although sales quotas can seem daunting, they are not randomly determined by an inept leadership team. They are carefully calculated and represent the portion of your company that you are responsible for.

The best reps realize this and view their quotas in the context of an invitation to contribute to their company's growth.

In a Darwinian sense, quotas can also be one of the most meritocratic measures for job performance. We all know someone who does not seem to do anything but can get promoted solely on their personality and charm. Sales is not the same.

Quotas are a way to say that reps who consistently underperform don't have any excuses.

#### Con #3: Quotas are stressful.

Salespeople are governed by their quotas. It doesn't matter if you are the best relationship builder on your team. Your quota can feel like an arbitrarily determined value that is designed to make you miserable when you're having a bad week.

#### Pro #4: Being helpful can easily surpass prospects' expectations.

People are wary about sales reps as they may contact them incessantly with information about products that they don't need or won't purchase. These low expectations are easy to meet.

The best salespeople understand that they shouldn't try to force prospects into buying. Instead, they come up with a mutually agreed-upon solution for a problem. Being a good listener and problem-solver can help you establish yourself as a trustworthy advisor.

#### Con #4: Salespeople are perceived as sleazy.

Prospects who have been in the unfortunate position of having to deal with pushy or manipulative salespeople will be less receptive and therefore more difficult to sell. These biases will be a problem when you try to sell to prospects. It's your job to put the "pro" into this profession and change the perception of Sales Reps.

#### Pro #5: You'll continue to build your muscles for specific tasks.

You'll be doing the same tasks day after day: Prospecting, calling, emailing, and creating pitch decks. These tasks are foundational and not necessarily exciting but they provide the building blocks for the big, exciting moments of sales. The only thing that will determine whether you feel the thrill of winning a big sale is how well you can endure the "boring" parts.

#### Con #5: Sales can become repetitive.

It is impossible to avoid it. Sales success requires repetitive tasks. There will be days when you need to prospect at scale or send so many emails that it blurs your vision.

#### Pro #6: You will solve different problems for different customers.

Every sales process is unique. Every customer has a different problem. This will ensure that you never have the same conversation twice.

It keeps your week exciting and engaging.

You will also become an expert in your field, and be able to create highly customized plans for your prospects. You may feel like you are experiencing deja vu in your sales calls. Reexamine your notes to determine if you have been having an excessively general conversation.

#### Con #6: Only one thing can be sold.

You still need to sell one thing, or a few products, at the end of it all. Talking about one product with one set of features and one value proposition can become monotonous.

#### Pro #7: You will improve your ability to deal with rejection.

Sales is not without its challenges. It's not something you should do. It's part of the sales process. After all, you wouldn’t need to prospect and qualify at scale to close 100% of your leads.

It will initially be difficult, but you'll soon be able to bounce quickly back and approach every conversation with a positive outlook.

#### Con #7: You will deal with a lot of rejection.

Rejection sucks. It can be demoralizing and it is natural to want to quit after receiving 10 rejections in a row. This will be a chance to stand out and prove that this career choice is right for you.

You just pick up the phone and start prospecting again. This will allow you to solve more problems for customers.

### Sales Is A Great Career For The *Right Person*

Sales provide an exciting and challenging career that will allow you to grow professionally and personally. A career in sales is for you if you approach the items with excitement and anticipation. You can prepare as best as you can using the best sales training materials and you will be able to achieve a successful future as a sales professional.

### Summary

We have just highlighted above why is sales the worst possible career - and its benefits. Yes, sales have drawbacks, but it's still a necessary and important part of the economy. Despite being the worst possible career, sales is still a great choice for many people.

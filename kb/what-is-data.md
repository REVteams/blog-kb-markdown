# What is Data?

## The historical period we live in is often referred to as the information age, owing to the important role information and its processing plays in everyday life, especially in terms of information technology.

One way to quantify information, as a key resource in modern society, is to classify it in the form of data.

#### Definition

The term data is used to refer to a unit or set of information that’s commonly formatted in a way that makes it easier to be accessed by users. With the advent of computers and computer science, data is predominantly being used to describe units of computer information and its storage that makes it easily accessible.

However, the term also has a broader usage, referring to any kind of information that’s formatted in a particular way that makes it accessible — anything from information that’s written on paper (texts, numbers, statistics, etc.) to information a person memorizes in their own mind. Likewise, different disciplines and sectors, such as demographics, finance, health, etc., will also have their particular definitions of data, each being slightly different.

#### Background

The word ‘data’ itself comes from Latin and is the plural of the word ‘datum’, which means something given. While the history of the contemporary usage of the word data dates a few centuries back, its predominantly accepted definition — as storable and accessible units of information — can be traced back to the mid-20th century.

#### Data science

The field of study dealing with big amounts of data with the aim of uncovering patterns and extracting information that can be used in practice is known as data science. This type of science often uses complex tools and technologies, such as machine learning algorithms, to construct predictive models of data analysis.

As such, data science is closely related to [data mining](https://www.britannica.com/technology/data-mining), which is a process used to turn raw data — the unprocessed, uncorrected collections of information — into processed data ready to be accessed and used by end-users. This is done by going through large amounts of raw data and ‘cleaning’ it from potential [outliers](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section1/prc16.htm), as well as any types of data measurement and entry errors. Then, data mining specialists process this data to turn it into valuable information. For example, a supermarket could be using the available raw data they gather from loyalty cards they give out to their customers. By processing this kind of raw data into functional information, these supermarkets can determine which customers buy which products. Their customers’ consuming habits can help supermarkets elaborate marketing strategies on things such as product discounts, promotions, and more.

As data science deals with vast quantities of data, it’s also related to the concept of [big data](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/big-data/what-is-big-data.html), which denotes enormous volumes of data, both processed and unprocessed, that can’t be interacted with through traditional data management tools because of their sheer size. Data volumes that are in the [petabyte](https://wasabi.com/help/glossary-of-terms/petabyte-definition/) range or higher are usually considered big data. In the business sector, and particularly in the ever-expanding eCommerce, business models revolving around big data have been formed. Businesses using these models consider data an asset and use big data to reduce their expenses, increase their effectiveness, drive sales, and more.

#### Data Sources

Data is collected through data sources, which can be divided into two main groups:

* **Primary data sources** — When an individual or a group of people (commonly researchers) is collecting data from a primary source, it means that they’re the first one(s) to have gotten said data. Data can be collected from primary sources through the means of observations, interviews, surveys, case studies, and similar direct methods.
* **Secondary data sources** — Collecting data through secondary sources means that this data has already been previously collected through another primary source that has then made it available in one way or another. Examples of secondary data sources include scientific journals, official statistics, government reports, informative media, research done by third parties, and more.

#### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Data

There are two main ways of collecting and analyzing data, and that is through qualitative and through quantitative research.

### Qualitative Research

In qualitative research, analyzing data is based on data portrayals, images, videos, written descriptions, and the like. Because this way of generating data can be somewhat non-exact and complex, it’s commonly utilized for exploratory research. Here, data specialists have to manually assess data from their sources, and then also manually process it to provide a finalized result that can be accessible to end-users.

This kind of research is commonly expressed in written form, as it’s used to describe concepts, thoughts, and experiences. Methods for performing qualitative research include open-ended question surveys, interviews, written observations, reviews of concepts and theories, and more.

### Quantitative Research

Quantitative research, on the other hand, deals in numerical data analysis. Because of this, it can often be measured through automatized data-collection tools, especially when it comes to computer-stored data. This kind of research is mostly used to test theories and establish generalized conclusions or facts.

Quantitative research is commonly expressed through graphs and other numeric visualizations. Methods for performing quantitative research include numeric observations, close-ended question surveys, experiments, and more.

#### Summary

Data is a set of information formatted so as to make it accessible by end-users. Nowadays, the term is commonly used to refer to information stored and shared on computers, though in broad terms, it could include any kind of information formatted for accessibility, from paper-written data to facts that people simply memorize.

The word ‘data’ comes from Latin, and it’s the plural of the world ‘datum’ which means something given. When it comes to its modern usage, especially concerning information technology, it can be traced back to the mid-20th century.

The field of study using vast volumes of data to uncover patterns and come up with usable information is known as data science. This kind of science is related to the concepts of big data and data mining.

Sources for collecting data can be divided into primary and secondary data sources. When it comes to analyzing data, there are two main ways to do so — through qualitative and quantitative research.

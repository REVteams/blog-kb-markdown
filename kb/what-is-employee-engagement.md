# What is Employee Engagement?

## Any business owner that hires employees knows how important it is to maintain good relationships with them. The way employees feel about their engagement within a company can make or break a business.

Business-employee relationships are multifaceted and made up of several different aspects that can often be measured. One such aspect is known as employee engagement.

#### Definition

The term employee engagement is used to describe the level of commitment of employees, or the process through which they are driven to commit themselves to their work for a company. Companies use the concept of employee engagement to create an image of how motivated their employees are on the job, their passion for what they do, their enthusiasm for work, and the amount of discretionary effort they put into it as a result. Employee engagement also indicates how connected employees are to the company they work for and how dedicated they are to promoting its brand.

#### Employee Engagement vs. Employee Satisfaction

Oftentimes, employee engagement is compared to — and sometimes even equated with — the very similar concept of [employee satisfaction](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/up-employee-satisfaction-22231.html). While both of these concepts are used to describe an employee’s relationship with the business they work for, they aren’t identical.

The term employee satisfaction is used as a measure of the employee’s contentment and level of satisfaction with their workplace. This concept is simply used to describe how happy an employee is with their job and working conditions, without actually analyzing how motivated, involved, or emotionally committed the employee is.

In reality, it’s far more common for employees to be satisfied with their work than to be really engaged with it. A satisfied employee can be someone who simply likes (or doesn’t complain about) the general working conditions they operate under, has a decent salary or overall satisfactory [compensation](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-compensation), and doesn’t necessarily do more than the bare minimum to contribute to the company they work for.

Employee engagement, on the other hand, measures the degree to which employees are ready to go the extra mile for the businesses they work for, and how ready they are to produce extra value for them. High employee engagement is an indicator of the personal connection employees feel with their companies and the level at which they feel fulfilled and self-realized while working.

With that in mind, besides the similarities between the two concepts, the qualities of satisfied and engaged employees are often in direct opposition to each other. When businesses improve employee satisfaction without working on increasing engagement, this doesn’t always result in increased employee commitment and performance. On the contrary — employees who never go beyond simple satisfaction with their work usually don’t count among the company’s high performers, whereas engaged employees do. Engaged employees are always ready to try out something new, constantly work on improving themselves, and contributing more, which goes hand in hand with higher performance rates. Those employees that merely seek to be satisfied by their job are less likely to accept new challenges, increased responsibilities, and aren’t keen on providing extra value to the company.

#### The Importance of Employee Engagement

Employee engagement is the driving factor behind high employee performance, which makes it a crucial measurement for businesses. When employee engagement levels within a particular company are high, it means that employees feel they belong. Engaged employees understand their place within the company as a whole. This usually comes as a result of the company’s increased effort to make its employees feel valued, inspired, and heard.

The benefits of working in an environment where employees feel engaged can be huge. When employees feel more connected to the company and each other, their everyday work activities happen more smoothly and they become better at decision-making. Companies that manage to successfully engage their employees commonly perform better than their competitors in the same field, too.

Most importantly, companies that value and engage their employees have a better chance at winning over high-quality hires and new talent. With the ever more dynamic workforce and job market, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to attract and retain top performers. A successful business can show high-quality job seekers that it values their skills, that it can give them space to grow, and that their ambitions can fit right in with the team’s values.

#### How to Measure Employee Engagement

Many companies use surveys when measuring employee engagement. These surveys are commonly made up of several parts that evaluate different aspects of engagement, such as the employee’s performance, their overall competency, their job satisfaction, their dedication to the brand they work for, and so on.

It’s important to note that companies should always compare their employee engagement surveys with approved benchmarks used by statistically validated actors (usually companies working in the same or a similar sector). If they don’t compare their results against those of relevant parties that have also measured employee engagement before, the results companies get won’t necessarily be understood as either good or bad, which means they won’t be able to determine whether they need to put in an extra effort to engage employees further or not.

While shorter questionnaires can also be used, as a rule of thumb, the regular employee engagement survey should have at least 50 questions on issues relevant to the different aspects that make up engagement. These questions should ideally be open-ended — this will motivate employees to provide as much information as possible, facilitating the process of measuring their overall engagement.

#### Summary

The term employee engagement refers to the measure of the level of commitment of employees to their job, as well as the process that drives this commitment. Through measuring employee engagement, companies can get an idea of their employees’ motivation to work for them, their enthusiasm, how much effort they put into their work, as well as how connected and dedicated they are to the brand they work for.

Employee engagement is often compared to (or sometimes even equated with) the similar concept of employee satisfaction. The difference between these two concepts is that, while employee satisfaction is merely an indicator of how happy employees are with their job, employee engagement goes a step further to show how enthusiastic and passionate employees are for their job, and whether they’re willing to put in extra efforts to provide more value to the company they work for. Employees who settle for job satisfaction don’t usually count among a company’s highest performers, whereas engaged employees do.

Employee engagement is a crucial aspect of business operations precisely because it is a key factor for driving employee productivity. Engaged workers perform their daily tasks more easily and are able to make better decisions. Companies with a highly engaged environment are more likely to attract and retain top performers in their sector.

When measuring employee engagement, companies commonly use surveys. These surveys contain multiple (ideally open-ended) questions that account for the various aspects comprising employee engagement.

# What is an Independent Software Vendor (ISV)

## Various kinds of companies and other legal bodies create software for end-users. Most commonly, hardware manufacturers, like IBM for example, distribute and sell software to go with their hardware products.

Even entities such as banks can create their own software for their clients’ use.

Apart from these, there are also specific types of software creators that specialize in making and selling software under conditions that are a bit different from those of non-specialized companies. These are known as independent software vendors or ISVs.

### Definition

Independent software vendors (ISVs) are software producers who aren’t related to hardware companies, and whose primary goal is to sell the software they produce to a wide target audience in the market. Individuals and organizations can both qualify as ISV.

The ISVs’ software is meant to sell to mass or niche audiences. In this, ISVs are different from both software creators that make in-house software, which is meant only for internal use within the company that creates it, and from custom software creators, who design software that’s only meant to be used by a single client.

The software ISVs create and sell is merely meant to be used by the clients who buy it. ISVs retain the ownership of such software to themselves, it’s simply licensed for use by the end-user.

### How Do ISVs Distribute Their Software?

ISVs often sell software solutions that haven’t already been created by primary vendors, such as hardware producers and OS companies, with the purpose of enhancing their systems for their users.

Likewise, hardware producers, OS companies, and cloud platforms can often support different ISVs in turn. They do this by testing the software created by ISVs who wish to make it available on their systems and platforms. Then, they pick the best ones among these software solutions and feature their creators as their **ISV-certified** vendors. This helps these ISVs greatly in the promotion of their products and enhances their revenue as a result.

Some companies also have **ISV partnership** programs that are very similar to ISV certifications. They both allow ISVs to sell software by placing it on the market for the specific hardware, OS, or cloud companies, where end users can buy it. The difference is that ISV certifications are much more exclusive than their partnership counterparts.

As an example, Microsoft has an ISV certification program, offering ISVs the opportunity to enlist for their silver and gold competencies, while Dell has an ISV partner program available. Unlike the rigorous tests that Microsoft will put ISVs through, to get Dell’s partnership, they’ll simply need to apply as a verified organization and await Dell’s approval.

Other companies that offer similar ISV partnership programs include Apple, Google, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, and more.

### What Areas Do ISVs Create Software For?

ISVs develop software that’s meant to work with different hardware, operating systems, or cloud platforms — or sometimes, it’s specific to a single platform, like, for example, Windows-exclusive software.

The software that ISVs distribute encompasses a wide range of apps, from the simplest utility programs to high-end, enterprise-tier solutions that cater to the needs of established companies. Oftentimes, ISVs can focus on a particular business niche, and dedicate themselves to creating software for that sector only.

In recent years, as cloud systems are becoming increasingly more significant, many ISVs have been focusing on creating more virtual-centric software. This market enables ISVs to sell their products as [SaaS](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/saas-10-faqs-software-service/) and to make use of public clouds and cloud marketplaces, including Amazon’s [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), Microsoft’s [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), and more.

ISVs come in all shapes and sizes—from student startups to established solution providers. If you develop, market, and sell your own software or applications, especially in the B2B space, then you are an ISV.

### Summary

Independent software vendors, or ISVs, are individuals or organizations that create, market, and sell their own software to end-users. They’re different from other software creators in that they only create software, often to enhance and add to what these other companies, such as hardware producers, already offer to their users.

ISVs can be designated as partners or certified by other companies, allowing them to sell their software on the marketplace that their partners have already established.

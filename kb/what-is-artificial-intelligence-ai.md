One aspect of computer technologies in particular — that of artificial intelligence, or AI — is especially present in everyday business activities nowadays.

#### Definition

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the combined capability of computers and programs (machines) to simulate human intelligence. AI technology unlocks the potential of machines to think like humans and mimic their actions, including traits such as learning and problem-solving.

Artificial intelligence can enable computers to learn, think, and act like humans without human assistance. Since the late 2000s, the field of AI research has seen major breakthroughs and has produced numerous industrial applications. Nowadays, AI is used across different industries to automate various tasks, processes, and in some cases even production.

#### Understanding AI

Consumers, often unknowingly, come across AI when they shop or interact with businesses online. Most of the time they interact with chatbots or they’re browsing through lists of products or suggestions generated by AI-powered recommendation systems.

Nonetheless, AI can be used in more complex business operations, such as big data exploration and predictive and prescriptive business analytics.

### Misconceptions About AI

History is rife with examples of skepticism and fear towards novel technologies and the case of AI is no exception. There are many misbeliefs about the use of AI and its impact on society and the economy. Most commonly, misconceptions about AI revolve around the impact it can have on organizations and jobs in particular. These are the top 4 misconceptions about AI.

#### Robots Equals AI

AI often gets confused for robotics, which is a similar IT and computer science concept. Artificial intelligence is not robots. It can be robots, but it is much more than that. Robots are programmed to perform automatic tasks, but most of the time they’re programmed by humans. However, robots increasingly contain some aspects of artificial intelligence.

#### Artificial Intelligence Will Be Rolled Out Across Entire Organizations

From today’s vantage point, taking in mind the current level of AI sophistication and development, it seems very unlikely that AI can be rolled out across entire organizations in the near future. What we can expect is that AI will continue to develop and better address business needs such as: automating business processes, gaining insight through data analysis, and engaging with customers and employees.

#### AI Will Replace Administrative Employees

Contrary to the popular belief, this has never been the main goal nor the common outcome of adopting AI. However, as technology improves, robotic automation projects are likely to lead to some job losses in the future.

#### If You Can Outsource a Task, You Can Probably Automate It

While AI has countless uses in business practice, it still can’t replace every single aspect of work. Still, there exist misconceptions that any task a company can [outsource](https://medium.com/coderslink/what-is-outsourcing-what-does-it-mean-for-companies-eff73fe60372) to other companies is probably mundane enough to be done by an AI. In reality, most activities that companies are likely to let others do for them, such as translations, disaster or lost data recovery, and more, still mostly require a specific human touch, and professionals can’t rely on artificial intelligence to completely take over such roles.

#### How Is AI Transforming Business?

As AI gains ground across industries and is being more widely implemented, it’s important to distinguish between the different types.

Some AI tools are smarter and more efficient, while others are less so. One example of the latter is AI-based process automation which is considered the least smart, the reason being that these applications aren’t programmed to learn and improve. However, their potential keeps increasing, as developers are slowly adding more intelligence and learning capability. For one thing, they’re particularly well suited to working across multiple back-end systems.

### Process Automation

Process automation is one of the main uses of AI and can be used to automate digital and physical tasks. In terms of running a business, AI applies more to digital task automation which can range from back-office administrative tasks to more complicated financial and managerial activities. On the other hand, automation of physical tasks is more common in industrial production where AI can be used to automate robotic/machine processes, which is something that you can see in Tesla’s car production lines.

When operational, AI-powered business-process automation tools behave like humans when it comes to inputting and processing information, with the added benefit of being able to consume information from multiple IT systems simultaneously.

As such, AI-based automation tools can perform various tasks:

* **Data transferring**: Processing and transferring data from data collection systems such as call center and e-mail systems into systems of record.
* **Data updating**: Upon instruction AI-based, automation tools can access multiple systems to update records.
* **Communications**: AI automation is widely used in customer communications where companies use it to gather relevant information for customer service queries.

Process automation with AI has been around for some time now and innovation and fast industry adoption have brought the costs of implementing and running AI-based automation tools down considerably. This makes process automation one of the least expensive and easiest AI tools to implement.

One of the most important indicators of AI efficiency is the rate at which transactions can be completed without human intervention.

### Cognitive Insight

Cognitive insight, also known as machine learning and deep learning, refers to the use of AI to detect patterns in large samples of data and make sense of their meaning. The whole concept of cognitive insight is built upon machine learning which is the ability of computer systems or programs to adapt and improve in performing tasks without following instructions (i.e. human factor). They do so using algorithms and statistical models to learn from patterns in data. These are some of the most common business uses of cognitive insight:

* **Behavior prediction:** cognitive insight can be used to predict what a certain customer is most likely to buy.
* **Identify suspicious behavior in real-time:** This is mostly used by banks and payment companies to detect fraudulent behavior and payment attempts.
* **Automatic customer targeting:** Target customers with personalized targeting of digital ads.

Cognitive insight is being used more widely by businesses due to its ability to process large pools of detailed data. Additionally, these types of AI tools are getting better at performing more complex tasks with time.

Other use cases of cognitive insight include recognizing images and speech, data mining, and data curation, for instance. Due to the complexity, time sensitivity, or vastness of the tasks using cognitive insight, it is used on jobs only machines can do.

### Cognitive Engagement

This use of AI is aimed at engaging people using natural language processing. Most commonly, this is done with chatbots for various purposes.

### AI-Powered Customer Support

This application of AI allows businesses to offer round-the-clock support to customers with intelligent agents. AI-based customer support can be used to address a wide range of customer issues such as technical support, password requests, client verification, and payment method updates.

### Recommendation Systems

Companies that operate product or service catalogs can use AI to offer recommendation systems that increase personalization and engagement with their clients. Based on customers’ interests, cross-site tracking, previous behavior, and purchases, intelligent recommendation systems can improve sales and customer satisfaction.

#### Artificial Intelligence in Marketing

Marketing teams across industries are adopting AI technology solutions to boost operational efficiency while enhancing customer experience. AI-powered marketing tools enable marketers to gain a more nuanced comprehension of their existing and potential customers. Marketers can then use the data and insights collected with AI tools to optimize marketing workflows and workloads, leading to better conversion rates.

For the most part, the use of AI in marketing revolves around applying industry-specific artificial intelligence technologies that enable marketing teams to collect data, perform analysis, and automate decisions based on the insights gained. AI tools can be also used to systematically observe trends across various sectors or datasets that may be relevant for a company's marketing efforts.

Marketing is all about speed, and efficiency is the core benchmark. With that in mind, it’s not surprising that AI is mostly used at those points in the marketing workflow where speed is essential.

Building on datasets about users and customer profiles, AI tools can learn how to best communicate with them. This means that artificial intelligence can communicate tailored messages to specific customers at the right time and it can do that without any intervention from marketers. This is a classic example where automation and cognitive insight and engagement come together to boost efficiency. At the same time, this enables marketers to focus on strategic tasks that require more human nuance.

### Applications/Examples of AI in Marketing

* Data analysis
* Automated decision making
* Content generation
* Real-time personalization
* Natural language processing
* Media buying

#### AI in Sales

When it comes to sales, AI can help teams focus on strategic sales and business strategy development by taking off the burden of routine and menial tasks through automation. Not only can AI save a lot of precious time, but its positive impact can also be recognized in that it allows sales teams to see the bigger picture and focus on what matters — creating strategies to generate more leads.

Sales reps can often be burdened with monotonous tasks that take up a lot of time and create bottlenecks. Artificial intelligence, and specifically machine learning, can help take some of that load off so they can have more capacity to focus on strategic aspects of sales and improve customer experience.

The most beneficial application of AI in sales is related to the use of machine learning in data collection and processing. As we already alluded, manually combining different bits of prospects' information can be time-consuming, as well as qualifying and following up with leads. AI-powered sales tools can take on those duties and help marketers reach out to specific and targeted prospects, as well as following up with them to build up a relationship.

This means that adopting AI can result in a significant drop in costs, as businesses can automate most of the low-level sales activities. Additionally, AI-based sales tools can boost up-selling and cross-selling by enabling sales representatives to more easily identify prospects who are likely to buy from them.

### Applications/Examples of AI in Sales

Sales applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning include:

* Data gathering from multiple datasets, processing, and consolidation;
* Updating customer files with address changes or service additions;
* Profiling and honing customer profiles.;
* Content creation;
* Communicating content to leads.

#### Summary

As artificial intelligence technology advances and businesses become more comfortable with deploying AI tools, we can expect to see major shifts in how businesses operate.

On the front end, we can expect customer interactions to be taken over by AI, with intelligent agents helping customers with frequently asked questions and resolving their queries. On the back end, the automation of peripheral tasks and data crunching is the aspect most likely to be completely covered by AI.

These deadlines are often related to the financial activities and reports that companies have to complete on a regular basis, as well as periodic quotas they set for their employees to fulfill. One of the many different ways to set up regularly recurring deadlines that companies can use for operational purposes is by using the end-of-year concept (or EOY for short) as a reference.

#### Definition

The term end-of-year (EOY) is often used in business terminology — usually specific to sales and accounting practices — to refer to a year’s end as a deadline for various tasks and quotas to be fulfilled. In the context of sales, EOY usually refers to quotas that companies give their sales professionals, tasking them to have a certain number of [deals closed](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-closing-a-deal) by the end of the calendar year (that is, by December 31st every year).

In accounting, on the other hand, the term EOY is usually used to denote the end of a twelve-month time period known as a fiscal year, which doesn’t necessarily coincide with the end of the calendar year — and, in practice, it often doesn’t. Here, EOY refers to the deadline at the end of the fiscal year before which organizations and their accountants have to complete certain tasks related to their financial functioning.

Whether they refer to sales or accounting, EOY deadlines occur on a regular, periodic basis — in this case, yearly. There are other similar deadlines such as end-of-month (EOM) and end-of-quarter (EOQ).

#### EOY Deadlines in Sales

Many companies that deal in sales practice setting up periodic quotas for the sales professionals that work for them — including EOY quotas. This means that, whenever there’s an EOY quota to fulfill, sales professionals have to close a specific number of sales predetermined by the management team of the company they work for, usually at the very beginning of the year in question.

As a rule, sales quotas are related to [commissions](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-commission) that companies pay their sales team employees as part of their salaries, which often means that the more sales they manage to close, the higher their overall [compensation](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-compensation) will be. Usually, however, this is relevant for end-of-month (EOM) quotas, since salaries (including commissions) are commonly paid on a monthly basis — but there are some cases where companies actually pay their sales representatives [yearly commissions](https://work.chron.com/annual-commission-25723.html) and bonuses as well.

For businesses, setting up EOY sales quotas — much like monthly and quarterly quotas — is useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

* Forecasting future sales expectations;
* Setting up competitive compensation plans for sales employees;
* Locating weak spots or underperformance in the business’s sales structure;
* Locating successful sales professionals and promoting their approach to sales;
* Regulating sales expenses;
* Motivating sales employees to perform better;
* And more.

With that in mind, EOY sales quotas should be ambitious but never impossible to achieve. If it’s obvious that the quotas have been set too high and that they can’t be achieved even through enormous efforts, this can have an opposite effect on the morale of the sales team. Instead of being motivated, salespersons will often see no point in trying to sell more if they aren’t able to meet their EOY quotas no matter how hard they try. They can also lose their confidence, since unattainable quotas can make it seem like they’re doing a bad job even if, in reality, their numbers are actually great.

### EOY Deadline Techniques and Challenges

As the EOY in sales is typically the same as the end of the calendar year, this means that sales professionals usually have to fulfill their predetermined quotas by December 31st each year as a deadline. In practice, this creates a particularly busy (and sometimes even stressful) atmosphere in sales environments around November.

At this period every year, as the EOY deadline approaches, salespersons that haven’t met their quotas yet often feel the pressure of having to speed up the process of [sales pitching](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/sales-pitch) to meet or exceed their target. What’s more, some prospects have their own EOY obligations to take care of, and they may be less keen on deciding in favor of purchasing during this particular period as it’s often easier for them to delay such decisions until after the start of the new year. This particular profile of prospects creates additional difficulties for salespersons rushing to fulfill their EOY quotas by the end of December, as they’ll often hit dead-ends if they focus on selling products or services to them.

For these reasons, sales teams use a number of techniques to increase their EOY sales numbers. Perhaps the most common way for salespersons to attract [buyers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer) during this time of the year is by introducing EOY discounts for products and/or services. They can also offer their target audiences special EOY promotions, including things such as special features, higher-tier subscription plans, advanced services, two items for the price of one, and other benefits to customers that make purchases before the year’s end.

#### EOY in Accounting

In accounting, as a rule, EOY refers to the end of the fiscal year rather than the end of the calendar year, though the two can sometimes coincide. When the end of the fiscal year begins depends on the country as well as the type of organization.

Businesses, governmental organizations, nonprofits, as well as educational organizations can have different concepts of an EOY of the fiscal year, even among themselves in their own sectors. As a common practice, fiscal year EOYs are usually set at the end of a quarter — either December 31st, March 31st, June 30th, or September 30th.

Accountants need to have their financial statements ready by EOY, commonly at the end of the fiscal year. Financial records needed for statements are commonly found in companies’ accounting books, including income statements, cash flow statements, balance sheets, and more. Accountants also need to handle their bookkeeping duties by the EOY date.

Obligations related to federal tax reporting are also on the plate for accountants working to fulfill their EOY duties. This is usually tied to the end of the tax year rather than that of the fiscal year, but these two often overlap — in fact, businesses may file their taxes using either a fiscal or a calendar year.

Other tasks that accountants need to have finished by the EOY date include collecting past due invoices, gathering forms for paid employees as well as independent contractors, checking payroll records, accounting for the business’s inventory, organizing business receipts, reconciling bank accounts, and more.

#### Summary

End-of-year (EOY) is a term used in business terminology when referring to deadlines that are to be met by the end of a year. EOY deadlines are particularly relevant to the sales and accounting branches of businesses.

In sales, EOY refers to a date by which salespersons need to fulfill their yearly quotas — that is, to close a predetermined number of sales by the end of the year. In some cases, companies even pay yearly commissions to their sales representatives based on their ability to meet their quotas by EOY, although commissions are much more often related to EOM quotas instead.

EOY for sales usually coincides with the end of the calendar year, which is December 31st. This means that for salespersons that haven’t met their quotas, a stressful period usually begins around November when they start feeling under pressure as they race to close more and more sales by EOY.

In accounting, EOY is related to the end of the fiscal year, which can sometimes coincide with the end of the calendar year but not necessarily. Fiscal years vary by country as well as by types of organizations using them in accounting, and the fiscal year EOY can often be set at the end of a quarter — December 31st, March 31st, June 30th, or September 30th.

Accountants have to complete a variety of tasks before the EOY of their fiscal year. These tasks can include preparing financial statements, reporting taxes, collecting past due invoices, gathering forms, checking payroll records, accounting for inventory, organizing business receipts, reconciling bank accounts, and more.

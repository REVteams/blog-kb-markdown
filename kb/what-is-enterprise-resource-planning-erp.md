# What is Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)?

## Modern businesses, especially larger ones, often divide their workforce into several departments — such as sales, marketing, human resources, finance, accounting, and more.

All of these departments have hierarchies of their own and can function more or less independently, though they often have to remain in contact with one another when it comes to communicating decisions that concern the company as a whole. One of the most effective ways of maintaining communication between company departments is through the process of enterprise resource planning (or ERP for short).

#### Definition

The term enterprise resource planning (ERP) refers to the integrated management of different business processes such as planning, sales, marketing, human resources, and many more. The ERP process is commonly done in real-time and with the help of specialized ERP software solutions.

#### How ERP Works

Using ERP processes is characteristic of larger organizations, and especially large corporations known as enterprises. ERP software is usually categorized as a type of business management software, together with similar business-related software types such as [customer relationship management (CRM)](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-customer-relationship-management-crm) solutions.

ERP systems act as a junction between different departments’ computer systems within a company or any other type of larger organization. Each department usually has its computer system that is made to handle department-specific processes and tasks. ERP software solutions connect all of these systems pertaining to different organizational departments, making them all accessible through a single point and interface.

ERP software makes it possible for the members of particular departments to share their department-related [data](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-data) with the entire organization. To do so, the ERP gathers information about the state of tasks and processes of each department within a particular organization in a single database and makes it available to members of every other department within it. In this way, any member or employee who needs information about any department’s activities can easily access it.

ERP software solutions typically have an integrated system that operates in (or near) real-time. Traditionally, ERP software is installed [on-premise](https://www.techslang.com/definition/what-is-on-premises/), directly on the machines (computers) of organizations using it. However, with recent developments, more and more ERP solutions are sold through the SaaS model and hosted on cloud servers, which makes them accessible remotely through the internet rather than being installed on their users’ machines.

#### The Importance of Using ERP Systems

ERP software can help companies with different tasks, such as growing their business, slashing operational costs, increasing their productivity, and more. With that in mind, it’s important to note that ERP solutions can have a different effect depending on the nature of the companies that use them, and their effectiveness can vary accordingly.

### Centralized Information & Insights

ERP solutions help companies reduce their expenses by removing the need of duplicating data — every piece of information in every department is centrally available through an ERP solution, and thus different departments don’t need to maintain separate copies of each dataset. Centralizing information access through a single point means that ERP software also saves companies the effort of having to install multiple different software solutions that may not be compatible with one another.

By using ERP software, a company can get valuable insights into its own performance across different branches of its business. By integrating different processes across departments with the help of ERP software, companies can plan their resources more effectively.

### Productivity

When a company’s departments use an ERP solution to connect their processes, they optimize their workload across different branches of their business. This means that employees in companies using ERP software are able to do their tasks faster and better, come up with more accurate results, and reduce the need for repetitiveness in working with data, which has an overall positive effect on productivity.

Data centralization brings inter-organizational cohesion as well as better synchronization of workloads for employees across all departments. It also allows them to focus on more significant tasks by eliminating redundant and repetitive processes which would take up a much more significant amount of their time without an ERP solution.

### Accuracy and Effective Communication

The process of real-time data reporting can also be improved by using an ERP solution that centralizes information sharing within organizations. ERP increases the accuracy in data reporting, which in turn facilitates the processes of envisioning, planning, budgeting, and informing about operations within the company as well as to external stakeholders such as investors.

Businesses that strongly rely on effective communication with their partners and [clients](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-a-client) can also benefit greatly from using ERP software. The quick and centralized data access that ERP solutions provide enables businesses to rapidly provide their vendors, partners, and clients with any information they may need. This optimized information sharing with concerned parties helps drive [customer](https://asq.org/quality-resources/customer-satisfaction) and [employee](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/up-employee-satisfaction-22231.html) satisfaction alike.

#### Challenges of Using ERP Solutions

As with many other items containing the name ‘Enterprise’, ERP solutions are not cheap. Their prices can vary depending on several factors such as deployment types, number of users, and customization degree. In any case, implementing an ERP system can cost anywhere from [\$10 thousand to more than $10 million](https://blog.cfbs-us.com/blog-1/how-much-is-erp).

With that in mind, ERP solutions aren’t a guarantee for improving effectiveness in workloads. Each business must carefully consider its own organizational structure and the possibilities for making changes in it before it decides to invest the significant sum needed for purchasing even the most basic ERP solution.

In practice, if the leadership of a company has established a rigid internal structure and is unwilling to modify it, they may reap limited to no benefits from using ERP software. Some processes and software solutions that certain companies may have been using in the past can be incompatible with some ERP systems — if companies aren’t willing to give these up, they won’t be able to use the ERP system that isn’t compatible with them.

### Examples of ERP Solutions

Some of the more well-known ERP solution providers include companies such as:

* [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/erp/);
* [Microsoft](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-gb/erp/what-is-erp/);
* [SAP](https://www.sap.com/products/erp-financial-management.html);
* [Infor](https://www.infor.com/);
* [Epicor](https://www.epicor.com/en-us/industry-productivity-solutions/manufacturing/platforms/epicor-erp/);
* [Syspro](https://us.syspro.com/);
* And more.

Most ERP providers allow users to purchase both an on-premise and a cloud-based ERP solution.

#### Summary

The term enterprise resource planning, or ERP for short, refers to a kind of integrated management that centralizes different processes across departments within a business. ERP is usually done in real-time and with specialized ERP software — a kind of business management software that provides a link between the computer systems of different branches within a business, such as sales, marketing, human resources, and others.

It’s common for ERP solutions to use integrated systems that operate in (or near) real-time, providing a single database for the state of the processes and tasks across every department within an organization. ERP software is traditionally installed on-premise, and more recently cloud-based and SaaS ERP options have been made available as well.

ERP software helps companies slash costs by avoiding data duplication through its database centralization. Through ERP systems, companies can get an idea of their performance in all departments. The cross-department process integration that ERP solutions provide also helps companies with their resource planning.

As they provide a central point for members of different departments to communicate their processes through, ERP solutions increase productivity by making workloads flow faster. They also eliminate repetitive processes, allowing company employees and other organization members across different departments to focus on more significant tasks. Real-time data reporting is made better by ERP software usage too, as well as the inter-organizational cohesion across members of different departments.

While they bring many benefits to companies, ERP solutions are also very costly. Their effectiveness will also depend on the nature of the organizations using them, and those who are reluctant to abandon older software and processes that aren’t compatible with ERP systems will not reap many benefits — if any — from ERP software usage.

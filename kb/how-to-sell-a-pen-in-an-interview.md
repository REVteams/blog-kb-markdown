### Why You'll Want to Know How to Sell a Pen in an Interview

You must be able to answer difficult questions in a way that shows your skills as a salesperson when you prepare for a job interview. Interviewers ask questions such as "Sell me this pen" to assess your sales skills and techniques when under pressure. 

### The Situation

Things are going well in a job interview for a sales position. The interviewer then presents the challenge you expected (yet still dreading) "Sell me that pen."

This prompt can send your stomach tumbling to your feet. It can be difficult to think quickly, and when you add in the fact that nerves are running high, it's easy to draw a blank or stare blankly at the pen.

You can make your answer stand out by practicing and preparing, just like with any other type of job interview question. What do you need to know to answer a "sell me some" interview question effectively?

####Interviewers ask this question because they are curious.

This type of question is often asked in sales interviews.

Although a pen is the most common sales prompt, it's not the only one. Your interviewer might ask you to sell a bottle of water or simply "Sell me something."

Then, have you select an item in the room, and then state your pitch.

It is tempting to believe that they are only asking you this to stump or put you in a difficult spot. Sales jobs are high-pressure jobs.

*"Interviewers want to see how your answer the question, and not what you say,"* says Neely Rafflini, Muse Career Coach, founder of the 9-5 Project.

Do you respond confidently? Are you genuine?

You'll find yourself in sticky situations in any sales role. Interviewers don't expect you to give a flawless answer, although that doesn't hurt. They simply want to see how you react to pressure.

#### Improve your skills. 

**Think about what the interviewer wants to accomplish.** The interviewer isn't trying to confuse you by asking you to "sell" them the pen. They are asking you to demonstrate how well your pen knowledge is gathered, communicated, and delivered.

**Do your research about the interviewer before you go.** What is their job? What information does a Google search reveal about their job responsibilities and position? 

**Practice your answer with a friend.** Ask them to play the role of the interviewer and sell you a pen. Ask them for their suggestions on how to improve your response.

Practice your answer multiple times.

#### Avoid using the "Sell me this pen!" technique.

There are certain answers to this question that are better than others. 

**Do not decline to answer.** It is an obligatory activity. Both you and the interviewer should answer this question.

Your chances of getting hired by a company are likely to be hampered if you say that you aren't comfortable answering questions or aren't sure how to answer them. Be positive and open to the possibility.

**Don’t be distracted by the pen’s features.** While technical details like the ink type and color can be useful for a salesperson, they are only a small part of the selling process. It's important to think about how the pen can benefit someone and their needs.

### Tips for a solid "Sell me this pen" answer.

It is comforting to know that employers care more about your overall demeanor than the content of your responses.

You still need *something* for your answer (and it should be impressive and effective). These are four tips to help craft an effective answer to this question.

#### Be confident.

Remember that the interviewer is only asking you this question to see how you respond when you feel under pressure or caught off guard.

No matter how well you deliver your sales pitch, confidence is key. 

When giving a sales pitch, it is important to appear poised and self-assured. Nonverbal cues such as keeping your head up, maintaining eye contact, and smiling can help convey this image to your audience. It is also important to speak clearly and with conviction. 

#### Highlight a need.

Leonardo DiCaprio's character in *The Wolf on Wall Street* tells a salesperson "Sell me this pen!" He then requests the salesperson to write down his name. Without any type of writing utensil, it is impossible.

*"The purpose of the exercise is to prove that he requires the pen,"* Dan Ratner, a former account executive for The Muse, says.

Ratner adds, *"Your goal should be to dig deeper and understand why they need what you're selling." "Usually, this is done by asking "Why?"*

Ratner shows the power of asking these types of questions with the following interview question and answer example.

**Interviewer** "Sell Me Something."
**Candidate** "Okay. What do you need?"
**Interviewer** "An entirely new car."
**Candidate** "Why do I need a new vehicle?"
**Interviewer** "My car is a gas guzzler, and I want something with better MPG."
**Candidate** "Why would you like a better MPG?"
**Interviewer** "I'm tired of spending tons of money to fill my SUV. I want to save money.
**Candidate** "Why does it matter to you to save money?"
**Interviewer** "I'm saving up for a house."
**Candidate** "I hear that you need a car that will help you save money over the long-term so you can purchase a home." Is that correct? 
**Interviewer:** "Yes, exactly."
**Candidate:** "How serendipitous! I am in the business selling electric cars. I would love to help you realize your dream of becoming a homeowner.

Do you prefer cash or credit?

#### Focus on the benefits and features.

It's important to connect your sales pitch with specific needs. You can also draw attention to the benefits or features of the product you're being asked to sell.

This is about creating a unique value proposition for the item.

### Summary

When learning how to sell a pen in an interview, the question is normally asked in interviews for sales positions. The interviewer wants to know if you have basic sales skills. Turn the question into a qualifying session and learn the client’s needs.

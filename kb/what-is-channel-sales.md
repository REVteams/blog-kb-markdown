# What is Channel Sales?

## When businesses attempt to scale their revenue, they can face several obstacles along the way.

Perhaps the most difficult of these obstacles can be the limited capability of a business to increase its sales — the main activity that generates revenue for them — by relying solely on its team of sales representatives.

While hiring a professional sales team and investing in the productivity of each sales representative can certainly bring about an increase in sales and revenue, in reality, there’s only so much a company’s sales team can do on its own. Usually, a company’s own salespeople, even at their most productive, simply don’t have the time to live up to the full sales potential the company they work for can attain.

To overcome this obstacle, some companies resort to hiring even more salespersons. This can help them take advantage of more sales opportunities, of course, but on the other hand, hiring and training new staff members is a costly and time-consuming process. That’s why, instead of relying on direct sales done by their own sales team, companies increasingly resort to alternative strategies such as **channel sales.**

#### Definition

Channel sales is a method that a company can use to classify and deploy its sales force into groups focusing on different distribution channels such as in-house sellers, retailers, dealers, value-added resellers, direct marketers, and more.

These distribution channels constitute a company’s channel partners — that is, third-party organizations or individuals that market or resell the company’s products or services to end-users, usually their own customers.

#### How Companies Benefit From Channel Sales

For companies, having their products or services resold by third parties can bring many benefits to their revenue, and their business in general.

For one thing, their third-party partners have a network of customers to add to those of the company itself. More often than not, these customer networks are far wider than the company’s own network. That’s because these channel partners — resellers, distributors, and so on — are the kind of parties that specialize in enlarging and strengthening their customer base. That’s something that their contractor companies may not excel at since they’re usually focusing on producing and providing products and services.

What’s more, outsourcing sales to channel partners saves companies money. Apart from being an effective sales strategy, channel sales also remove the need for companies to enlarge their sales departments by constantly hiring new salespersons. This can slash their maintenance costs dramatically.

#### Downsides of the Channel Sales Model

While there are considerable advantages that channel sales can bring to companies, there are also some disadvantages they may face when selling through this model. One of the downsides with a high impact for companies that rely increasingly on selling through channel partners instead of their own sales team is that they exert less control over their business. The very fact that these companies essentially outsource their selling through channel sales means that they won’t be able to wholly manage their sales cycle from A to Z.

Reliance on channel sales can also have unpredictable effects on a company’s image and brand. While it is a general rule of thumb that companies should always entrust only the most reliable partners with reselling and marketing their products or services, these partners are still separate, third-party entities. They may make certain mistakes while presenting the company’s items to their end-users, and this could have an effect on the company’s reputation. After all, end-users, in most cases, only consider the brand, so they may hold a company accountable for the consequences of their channel partner’s mistakes.

Another evident downside of channel sales is revenue sharing. Reselling and marketing outsourcing deals mean that the channel partner will either get a cut of the profit, usually measured in percentage, or get a regular payment from their contractor companies — the former being more common than the latter. In any case, paying channel partners is a cost that can be avoided if companies stick with their own sales teams instead of opting for the channel sales model.

What’s more, by getting third parties to distribute its products or services to end-users, a company either significantly decreases or outright loses its direct contact with these customers. This can have a negative impact on the company’s business for several reasons: it doesn’t get feedback from customers, fails to obtain insights into their needs, and thereby misses the opportunity to learn how to improve its offer from those that use its products and services directly.

#### Summary

Channel sales are a model of selling through which companies outsource the marketing or selling of their products and services to third parties, known as channel partners. These partners can include organizations or individuals such as value-added resellers, redistributors, direct marketers, dealers, and more.

The channel sales models can be advantageous for companies for a number of reasons. Most notably, selling through channel partner resellers and marketers helps them reach marketplaces they wouldn’t manage to get to on their own. It also helps these companies slash enterprise costs, by eliminating the need of having to hire and train additional members to their own sales team, as channel partners act as their indirect sales force.

Apart from the advantages, there are also certain disadvantages of the channel sales model. For companies, lesser overall control over their business, possible impact on their brand from channel partner mistakes, shared revenue, and losing their direct contact with customers are some of the downsides of this model.

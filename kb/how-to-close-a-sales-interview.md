### Definition  

A closing statement summarizes why you are the right candidate to fill the position you are interviewing for. This statement highlights your skills and work experience that will benefit the company.

If you are applying for a position as a marketing coordinator, your closing statement could detail how the development and production of promotional materials have increased production.

#### Why is it important to make closing statements?

* Describes your interest in the company. The closing sentence reflects your enthusiasm for this position. Discuss the reasons this job is right for you and the company.
* Highlights your skills and qualifications. A closing sentence indicates how well you present yourself to an employer. If they decide to hire, give two to three examples of how your skills and experience can help the company succeed.
* Answers questions from the employer. An employer might ask you questions at the end to find out more about your past job or skills. Your closing statement may be used to answer their questions.

### Interview Tips to Close the Deal

It's the perfect time to showcase your talents and shine. Although you may be one in a million, you could be competing against dozens to land the sales dream job that you have always wanted. You can get an edge by being prepared and having an understanding of some of the elements you will encounter in the sales interview.

#### 1. Research, Research, and More Research

As you would with any prospect, research the company. What are they doing? And what are their core values?

This information is available on its website under "Mission Statement" and "About Us." This is only the beginning of your research. A look at its social media channels and mentions on the news will help you to get a better understanding of what they do.

**DO: Read thoroughly.**

Sales interview questions often ask about how you found out about the job, what you know about it, and how you researched it. You have the chance to "wow" your team by answering a question about your research. Mention a fact from their blog or online newsletter and they will quickly realize that you did more than just look at their homepage.

You will be remembered as a unique candidate and demonstrate that you can thoroughly research a prospect or lead before making contact.

**DON'T: Learn the basics.**

Although a glance at the website of the company is a good start, it won't give you enough information to be able to make a great job interview. You're missing out if you don't learn about the core business, their sales process, and any other companies they are affiliated with. You could accidentally say the wrong thing if you don't do enough research.

Think about it: Would you bring a cup of Dunkin' Donuts coffee to Starbucks if you were going to their job interview? This is a common mistake that can be made if you don't do enough research.

#### 2. Tell Us About Yourself

The biography section of the interview is where you can showcase your strengths and tell the interviewer what you can offer the team. You must be able to communicate your strengths positively and convince the interviewers about the benefits of working with you. The key to answering the question correctly is the "about me" section.

This involves understanding the job and what it entails.

**DO: Know What You're Applying For.** 

You must be able to describe the job you are applying for accurately and explain why you will meet or exceed company expectations. Consider yourself as a product that you are selling to the interviewing team. Let them know how you will benefit them.

It's nice to say "I'm an excellent salesperson," but it is better to say "I have exceeded my sales goals for 16 months and counting."

**DON'T: misunderstand the job and your abilities.**

You're missing out if you don't understand the company's selling approach or can't clearly explain how your talents and abilities will benefit them. Selling is all about being able to explain the benefits of any product, including your own, and you will lose out on the opportunity to sell.

#### 4. Be Prepared to Give Examples

An interview for sales will often ask about your sales approach and how you have dealt with selling problems in the past. Forbes recently advised interviewers to ask about the times when the process went wrong and what they did to fix it. Failure to answer the question fully can hurt your chances of being hired.

**DO: Be ready to give examples of situations using STAR:**

Situation (setting the scene)
Task (your role & what was required)
Action (what you did)
Result (make it positive)

The STAR approach is great for telling stories in an interview. It distills the incident down to its most essential facts and allows you to tell a compelling but concise story. You should have a few examples ready to go before you start the job interview.

**DON'T: Get caught up in the question or worse. Provide an example, but no solution/result.**

Complete examples not only show that you have dealt with situations and challenges well in the past but also demonstrate your communication skills. When you're faced with a STAR-type question, resist the temptation to ramble on or stray too far from the story you are telling.

#### 4. Dress for Success

Dressing to fit in with the company culture is more than a buzzword. It makes it easier for interviewers to see you as an employee. This can help you get one step closer to your dream job in sales.

**DO: Wear what you want to match the company culture and brand.**

It is important to dress appropriately for any position, but it's especially important for sales positions. Why is it so important? If you are hired, you will be the face and embodiment of the company when you visit clients.

You will become a living, breathing impression of the brand.

How does your appearance reflect on the brand? You could be overlooked if you dress poorly or in a way that doesn’t fit the company’s culture, values, and brand.

Include clothing and style when researching a company. If they are local, you might be able to see what their sales team wears. This information will help you to create a model for your interview and to blend in with the team when you get the job.

**DON'T: Take wardrobe risks.**

While a tie with a "funny" political quip about conservatives might not go over well in an interview at a well-respected conservative brand, an overly formal approach will not win you any fans at a more casual company known for its quirky sense of humor.

You've seen *Stepbrothers* and you'll understand how clothing affects perceptions. The brothers arrive at interviews dressed in tuxedos, which causes a lot of laughter. Although it's hilarious on the big screen, a mismatch between your dress code and the company culture could result in you losing the job you want.

#### 5. Close the Deal

Although you don't have to be aggressive, you should still try to close the deal, even if it is just to ask about the next steps. You will be missing out if you don't ask for the job or follow up.

**DO: Keep Closing in Your Mind** 

You can differentiate yourself from other interviewers by using mini-closings or trial techniques. Getting the interviewer to say yes throughout the session will help you stand out.

**DON'T: Be Too Aggressive**

Some businesses prefer a salesperson who follows the ABC method (Always be Closing), while others prefer a more relaxed approach. If you aren't sure which category a potential employer falls into, don't be too aggressive in your efforts.

### Leave a Lasting Impression

Salespeople sell. It's what they do. When you have found the perfect job sales, closing your interview speaks volumes about you and what you can do for a company.

That takes a certain touch.

Confidence is a virtue. You are confident that you can succeed in the sales role. The trick is convincing the HR rep or hiring manager.

Confidence is crucial in landing the job.

The interview is like a meeting with a potential client. It can help your cause if you are enthusiastic and confident about the widget you sell. It does.

When approaching an interview, think of yourself as that widget.

Establish a rapport. It's not a good idea to hire a stiff-necked salesperson to interview for a job, let alone to hire them to their sales team.

While it is important to act professionally in an interview, don’t confuse this with acting stiff, dull, and stale.

Conversational skills and building a rapport with interviewers are essential for a culture match with an organization. Ask them about their weekend and show genuine interest in them, especially for a Zoom interview that limits human connections.

Be bold and explore new territory. To add to the previous point, uniformity can be a headache for hiring managers. There are few things more frustrating than a constant parade of candidates who act, look, or speak the same when it comes to recruitment.

Another reason to be bold and different is that you should not hesitate to be different, provided that you do so within reason. Boldness can take many forms:

* *Ask where you stand in comparison to other candidates?*
* *Are they required to speak with their manager? Reach out to them directly.*
* *Ask for constructive criticism to improve your next interview.*
* *You should be enthusiastic and tell the company what makes you a great fit for this role.*

Get close with passion. You probably have a collection of stories and emphatic sayings that will help you close the deal. Or, at the very least, move the customer further down your sales funnel.

Isn't it logical to be as prepared to close an interview? Every candidate will do some background research on the company and job. How many people have put a convincing bow around an interview?

You're giving the sales team a preview of your skills, work ethic, demeanor, and perspective during an interview. You can think of it as a meeting with an A-list prospect. Do your research and close like a pro.

### Summary

When looking for ways how to close a sales interview, remember to do your research, be prepared to tell your story, and you'll be ready to face the sales interview. It could make the difference between landing the dream sales job or continuing your search elsewhere.

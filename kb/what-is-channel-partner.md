In this kind of relationship, the partners of the companies are called **channel partners.**

#### Definition

A channel partner is a person or organization that offers services, products, or technologies on behalf of another entity that originally produces or distributes them. In most cases, channel partners sign [co-branding](https://www.thebrandingjournal.com/2020/10/what-is-co-branding/) agreements with these producers that serve as the basis of their channel partnership.

#### How Channel Partnerships Work

Companies that produce and sell products and/or services use channel partners as their [indirect sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indirect-sales.asp) force — that is, as third-party resellers of their items.

This kind of partnership can bring many benefits to both the original producer/seller company and their channel partner. If the company picks its channel partners carefully, it can get a lot out of the deal. Good channel partners can help a company’s sales — and by extension, their revenue — increase significantly. This is especially true in cases where a channel partner already has a developed network of loyal customers which the contracting company also gains access to through the channel partnership.

The channel partnership relationship is also beneficial to channel partners. The partnership helps them generate additional revenue by selling new products and/or services to their customers. It can also help them gain new customers, attracted by the new items they’re selling.

Reselling from a diverse network of manufacturers and vendors helps channel partners diversify their own offers as well. This helps them be more competitive in the marketplace and enables them to meet their customer’s needs more easily with multiple products and services at their disposal.

What’s more, cooperating with more established vendor companies can be very useful for channel partners. For instance, they can use the expertise and resources of their more experienced contractors, such as technical assistance, marketing funds, product usage training, and more. They can also get more customer leads from those companies that already have a solid customer base.

All of this is especially true for channel partners of famous brand companies, which is a sort of advertisement for these partners in itself. Customers will be much more easily attracted to channel partners of well-established companies because of the respect and credibility this kind of partnership brings them.

#### Channel Partner Types

There are several different kinds of channel partners.

### Value-Added Resellers (VARs)

This is one of the most common channel partner types. VARs are companies that buy products or services from other vendors or manufacturers and enhance them with more features, increasing their value in the process. They then resell these products or services they’ve enhanced to end-users, that is, their own customers.

The added value VARs provide may come in the form of more products/services bundled with the existing ones, or in the form of other kinds of value enhancements such as providing customers with technical assistance, training them how to use the items they resell, installing these items for them, and more.

### Distributors

The task of a distributor is to mediate between the company that originally creates a product or service and another one of the company’s channel partners that resells this product or service to its end-users. Companies usually engage with distributors to gain quicker access to the market through them, as distributors usually have elaborate distribution networks they can put at their contractors’ disposal.

Distributors can also provide other benefits to the companies that resell through them, such as training, technical, and marketing support to the channel partners that sell the company’s products or services to their customers.

### Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)

This name can appear confusing when applied to a channel partner because its primary use is to designate a company that produces equipment for other companies to market or resell. However, the term OEM has also come to mean a company that buys products and services from other manufacturers to either rebrand them and market them as its own or enhance them with extra features and bundles for reselling (much like VARs).

### Systems Integrators (SIs)

This channel partner type specializes in bringing together component subsystems that it buys from other companies, and uses these to create a system to resell. SIs most commonly work in the IT industry and resell integrated subcomponents such as software and hardware.

### Managed Service Providers (MSPs)

MSPs are companies that take care of the maintenance of other companies’ infrastructures. They’re usually hired by other companies as channel partners that help them with maintaining their work network, as well as taking care of upgrades and installations for end-users, commonly in the IT sector.

#### Summary

Channel partners are individuals or organizations that engage in so-called channel partnerships with manufacturing or vendor companies to buy products or services from them and resell to end-users. These partnerships are mostly officialized in the form of co-branding agreements.

A channel partnership can bring many benefits to both the company that originally produces or sells products or services and their channel partners. A good channel partner with strong customer networks can act as part of the indirect sales force of a company, helping it expand its sales operations to a wider customer audience. Channel partners can also benefit from the expertise and brand of the companies they resell from, as well as from diversifying their own offer with these companies’ products and services.

There are many different kinds of channel partners, such as value-added resellers, distributors, original equipment manufacturers, system integrators, managed service providers, and more.

# Business Terminology - Account

Account

In business terminology, the term **account** has two major definitions or uses.

According to the first definition, specifically related to bookkeeping, an account is a fundamental component of an accounting system. Accounts are used to record financial activities in a general [ledger](https://www.beginner-bookkeeping.com/bookkeeping-ledgers.html) — a collection of multiple (sometimes hundreds) accounts that a business uses to sort and store information related to its transactions.

The second definition defines an account as a professional relationship between two sides. In this case, the two sides are usually doing business together; with one side as the seller and the other side as the customer.

We’ll go into more detail for each of these definitions below.

## Accounts as Accounting System Components

As per the first definition, businesses can keep different kinds of **accounts**. These can be divided into several categories based on the nature or the periodicity of flow.

By nature, accounts can be:

* **Real** — this includes records on physically tangible as well as certain intangible objects. An example of an account on tangible objects would be, for example, an account of the business’ computers. An example of an intangible account would be a business’ copyrighted materials.
* **Personal** — includes bank accounts and any other accounts related to legal entities.
* **Nominal** — includes income and expense accounts calculated for set time periods, usually fiscal years. A standard example of a nominal account would be a company’s Sales account, where all of the company’s sales are recorded.

By periodicity of flow, accounts can be divided into:

* **Incomes** — short-term inflows for a given financial period, usually a fiscal year.
* **Expenses** — short-term outflows for the given financial period.
* **Assets** — long-term inflows that reach beyond the given financial period.
* **Liabilities** — long-term outflows that reach beyond the given financial period.

Companies keep complete lists of their active accounts in their Chart of Accounts (COA). They employ accountants who are responsible for updating and reporting account balances.

## Accounts as Business Relationships

The second most common use for the term refers to it as a relationship, usually between a seller and a customer, where one of these sides is an **account** of the other. In this relationship, the two parties have a specific set of rights, obligations, and privileges they enjoy.

A common example of this use of the term is when businesses repeatedly sell to certain customers. In this case, the businesses consider these recurring customers as their accounts.

Businesses that keep customer accounts sometimes even employ **account managers** that work on a single account. The account manager’s job is to take care of the sales to the account they’re assigned, as well as everything else related to the professional relationship the business maintains with that particular customer.

## Summary

When talking about accounting, we refer to accounts as records of business transactions categorized either by nature or by the periodicity of flow. They constitute the main building block of accounting systems.

An account can also refer to a business relationship between two parties, usually a seller and a customer. In this case, one of the parties is referred to as the account of the other.

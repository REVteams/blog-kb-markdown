## When running a business, the people and teams behind it are faced with the need of making decisions on a daily basis.

For every activity associated with running a business to go through — from recruiting employees, closing sales, purchasing products or services, to determining salaries, and everything else in between — decisions have to be made on it first. The burden of making all the important decisions usually falls on the shoulders of one or several decision makers in a business. 

#### Definition

A decision maker is an individual in a business that has the power to decide on strategic steps said business will take. The term is commonly used to refer to those figures within the organizational structure of the business that are able to decide on higher-level issues such as making capital investments, expanding the business line, acquiring new assets, and the like. 

#### Who Can Be a Decision Maker

There’s usually more than one relevant decision maker in each business or company, and it can sometimes be a challenging task to locate all of them. A company’s [purchasing manager](https://www.robertwalters.com.au/career-advice/the-role-of-a-purchasing-manager.html), in charge of all of its decisions on purchasing products or services, is usually one of the most important decision makers in it. Other positions commonly in charge of decision making include [C-Level executives](https://rev.team/kb/c-level-c-suite-executives), vice presidents, and so on. 

For smaller companies of up to 10 employees, their CEOs are commonly the main decision makers. Companies sized 10-50 employees usually have vice presidents included in decision making as well. Those with more than 50 employees commonly have a specialized decision maker for each department, with examples including sales managers, marketing managers, business development managers, and more. In larger companies of more than 500 employees, having usually expanded across states, regions, and continents, the decision-making often rests with regional company representatives for each particular geographic area the company maintains a presence in. 

Oftentimes, decision making within businesses is done in groups or teams. This means that in such cases, a group of individuals reflects on every issue — commonly all of them together and at the same time — and agrees on the ideal decision together. This decision-making method has the benefit of including multiple different skills and a diversity of expertise that can bring about multi-faceted solutions to a business’s issues. When decision-making circles are larger, it can also help increase the motivation of all employees on the decision-making team, improving their work morale as well as their loyalty to the business they work for. However, group decision making can also complicate the process, leading to disagreements and rejection of responsibility for the results among individual members of the decision-making team.

#### How to Locate Decision Makers Within a Business

Locating the decision makers of particular companies is of special interest to sales professionals working in [B2B sales](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-b2b). It’s especially crucial for salespeople who deal in [complex sales](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-complex-sale) to be able to identify all the decision makers that have a say in purchasing new products and services at the companies they’re trying to sell to.  

A common way of determining all the relevant decision makers within a company is by looking at its website and social media profiles — especially [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), where the titles of individual company employees are often made public. Another way of locating decision makers is by contacting the company’s employees through the phone, e-mail, or any other means of direct communication, and asking them to provide information on company figures in charge of particular departments, which is something they’re usually very likely to share with anyone asking them about it. 

An important thing to note is that important decision makers often have gatekeepers, especially when it comes to larger companies. Assistants or secretaries often assume this role, serving as a point of contact between the decision maker and any external party trying to contact them. 

#### How Decision Making Works          

The process decision makers go through when making decisions can have several phases, including:

* The realization that a decision has to be made on a particular business-related issue;
* Gathering information relevant to the issue at hand;
* Coming up with alternatives for different potential decisions related to solving the issue;
* Comparing the potential outcomes of all of these alternatives;
* Picking the alternative deemed most effective; and
* Implementing the chosen alternative in practice.

The decision-makers’ job doesn’t stop there, though. For each decision taken and acted upon, they have to follow how it plays out in practice, take notes and review the decisions they took, and, if necessary, make changes to them to tackle some of their effects.

With the latest technological advancements, business-related decision making is often facilitated through the usage of [decision making software](https://www.g2.com/categories/decision-making), too. This kind of software gives decision-makers a number of different analytics that can speed up their decision-making process. Oftentimes, decision-making software solutions rely on gathering data from the [customer relationship management (CRM)](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-customer-relationship-management-crm) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software the business uses, helping decision makers get a clearer image of relevant trends that exist within the overall work of their business, which in turn enables them to tackle issues and take advantage of opportunities more effectively. 

#### Why Are Decision Makers Important

Taking on the responsibility of making all the relevant decisions to a business’s work is what makes the role of a decision maker crucial to the growth and success of a business. 

Decision makers will often consider each decision carefully, weighing down all their options before finally choosing the one they deem right, and even changing it later on if its effects fail to meet the expectations. In this way, decision makers serve as a safeguard, protecting their businesses from rushing into decisions that may prove harmful to them in the future. 

Decision makers are at the forefront of a business’s overall management, optimizing its various branches to help the business choose what’s best for it and prosper on the market. Decision making can make or break a business, which is why business owners often handle the diffusion of decision-making positions with great care.

#### Summary

The term decision maker refers to any individual in a business that can make important decisions related to the strategic steps of the business. Usually, individuals that have a say in higher-level decisions within a business are called decision makers.

A business’s purchasing manager is commonly a relevant decision maker, together with figures such as C-Suite executives, vice presidents, and the like. Businesses — especially larger ones — are likely to have multiple relevant decision makers. 

Depending on the business’s size, individuals in different positions within its structure — from CEOs to vice presidents to regional representatives and more — can assume the role of decision-makers. Oftentimes, businesses have groups or teams of decision makers, wherein all members discuss relevant issues together and agree on the decisions the business will take on these issues collectively.

Locating all decision makers within a business can be a challenging task, but it can be achieved through asking employees about it directly or visiting the business’s website and social media profiles. Decision makers sometimes have gatekeepers — a role usually filled by their assistants or secretaries — that serve as a point of contact between them and external parties contacting them.

The decision-making process can go through several phases, from gathering information to weighing alternatives to picking one of these alternatives and implementing it — and then revising it for potentially necessary changes to it. There exist decision-making software solutions that can help decision makers with this process, providing them with analytics acquired through gathering data from the business’s CRM and ERP applications.

Decision makers take their time to analyze every important aspect when making a decision, preventing their businesses from rushing into deciding on things that may end up harming them. They’re the ones in charge of the various aspects of managing a business, and of making these aspects function together in harmony. This makes decision makers key figures within a business, as its growth and success often depend on them.

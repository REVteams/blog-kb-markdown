Nowadays, as internet usage is expanding more rapidly than ever, many businesses have started focusing on online marketing to reach out to their prospects and convert them into [customers](https://rev.team/kb/what-is-buyer). Email campaigns are often part of online marketing strategies, and one particular way to do email marketing is by sending cold emails to prospects.

#### Definition

A cold email is a type of correspondence that businesses use to reach out to their prospects who have no prior knowledge about or contact with these businesses. The aim of these emails is to establish a primary business communication with these prospects, which can eventually become clients or customers further down the [marketing funnel](https://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-a-marketing-funnel). Cold emails can be described as the email version of [cold calls](https://rev.team/kb/cold-call).

#### Cold Emailing and Other Email Marketing Types

Some other email types that businesses use in email marketing include transactional and warm emails, the latter serving as the opposite of cold emails.

The primary use of transactional emails is to provide transaction info to a paying customer or client that has already agreed on a purchase — such as purchase invoices, order confirmations, online receipts, account password resets, and so on. However, because the rates of opening such emails are significantly higher than in other cases (such as promotional emails or newsletters), businesses can also employ them with a secondary, marketing-related use. For example, transactional emails can be used to promote service subscriptions, [cross-sell](https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/cross-selling) and [up-sell](https://www.oberlo.com/ecommerce-wiki/upselling) products or services, and more.

Warm and cold emails, on the other hand, are primarily used for marketing purposes, specifically with the aim of persuading a lead or prospect to further engage with the business in question, and eventually buy a product or service. The main difference is that warm emails are sent to prospects that the business has already had contact with, whereas cold emails are sent to those they’ve never had any significant interaction with.

#### Avoiding Spam Filters

Cold email receivers don’t expect to be contacted by these businesses they’ve usually never been in contact with before, but this doesn’t mean that businesses send out cold emails to random addresses they’ve found on the internet. In fact, through this method, businesses usually write to the email addresses of uncontacted prospects that already exist in their database. These addresses could have been acquired through various means, such as online questionnaires and other forms where users can leave their emails, direct referrals by other companies, and so on.

As businesses already have some info on these prospects, they create personalized cold emails to those among them that are most likely to be engaged in any kind of business conversation. This means that, while cold emails are unsolicited, recipients don’t get generic, spam-like emails. On the contrary, these emails are specifically designed with each individual recipient in mind, making them more trustworthy and easier to relate to than other promotional emails sent en masse.

Because of this level of personalization that’s typical of cold emails, the majority of them won’t be blocked by [spam filters](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/spam-filter). Of course, cold emails can often be sent to multiple receivers at once, so depending on the severity of particular spam filters, some of them may well end up in the spam folder after all.

#### How Cold Emails Work

Creating personalized cold emails requires research. To determine what leads are most likely to engage in any kind of business activity aimed at them, or even respond to the email, to begin with, businesses aim to gather as much relevant information as they can about each one of their prospect database entries.

The email addresses of leads interested in cooperating can be acquired in different ways, such as from users visiting the business’ website and filling in forms, subscribing to newsletters, commenting on the business’s social media pages, and more.

After assembling a list of leads and prospects to send cold emails to from the database, businesses and their sales or marketing representatives need to come up with a good email structure to maximize the chance of getting their recipients’ attention. To do so, they usually employ techniques such as:

* **Using the BCC function** — this is a measure that cold emailers should always use in case they actually send the exact same email to more than one recipient, which can sometimes be the case when multiple prospects have the same backgrounds or even personal names. Cold emails are supposed to be personalized and highly relatable, so the last thing the senders want is to make their recipients feel like they’ve gotten a bulk message sent to an entire list of different email addresses.
* **Email formatting** — leaving an excellent first impression is crucial when cold emailing. Successful cold emailers take good care of every aspect of their emails, from the subject line to the text itself. Even when they use templates, they try to avoid marketing cliches and selling phrases to avoid having their mail deleted, moved to the spam folder, or getting themselves on their recipients’ block list. They try to be short and to the point, and add as much relevant info about the business they work for as their prospects may need to be able to engage with them in the future.
* **Avoiding visual clutter**  — images or videos can be useful for attracting the attention of internet users, but it is much less so when it comes to emails. Cold email senders usually avoid these, as well as other intrusive visual characteristics such as huge fonts and too many colors in their emails, which can be very off-putting to unexpecting recipients.
* And more.

#### Advantages

The personal approach of cold emails makes them stand out from other online and email marketing techniques. Prospects are always more likely to respond when they feel like a business is writing to them personally, and not just sending them another automated marketing message or ad.

Cold emailing is also much easier to work with than other marketing techniques, be it online or offline. Sending emails to prospects — even when they’re highly personalized — can be automated, and is usually only one click away for experienced online sales and marketing teams.

As most people of all demographics have email addresses nowadays, marketing strategies such as cold emailing give sales representatives as much space as they could possibly need (and more) to try to reach out to as many potential customers as they can.

The extensive marketplace they can be used in makes cold emails useful for a number of purposes, such as generating new leads and prospects through the old ones, promoting the business and its events, doing market research through the recipients’ feedback, even potentially employing some of them after having established a relationship, and much more.

#### Disadvantages

While cold emailing can be useful to many businesses, it has its shortcomings. For one thing, the fact that a huge number of businesses are promoting themselves through various online channels — emails included — makes this kind of marketing a competitive environment.

The average internet user encounters online ads and marketing emails daily, so in order to stand out, cold email senders should really make an effort to get the attention of their recipients — or to avoid having their emails automatically sent to the spam folders in the first place.

Even well-formulated cold emails that manage to get to their end users’ inbox are more than likely to be ignored, if not deleted. Internet users are simply not very likely to open emails from unknown senders. The email — or the sender’s offer — really has to resonate with the recipient for them to even open it.

#### Summary

A cold email is a type of email that businesses and their representatives send out to prospects and leads they’ve never had significant contact with before, with the aim of establishing a business connection with them. Cold emails are the email equivalent of cold calls.

Even though they’re unsolicited, cold emails are personalized for each recipient. Cold emailers determine which prospects are most likely to engage in a business interaction with them, and then make efforts to create relatable emails that are likelier to receive a response.

Since most people have emails, cold emails have the potential for great reach. Their personalization and ease of use make them highly useful for reaching out to prospects as well as for generating new leads, promoting the business, conducting marketing research, and more.

However, the competitive scene of online and email marketing means that cold email senders need to make a real effort to make their emails stand out. Even so, emails from unknown senders are still likely to end up ignored by their recipients.
